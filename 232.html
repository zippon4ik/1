Start Whisp Island
Escape the Nightmare
You heard a familiar voice, and it turned out to be Benny. He asked you to accompany his friend Lottie to transport supplies, saying he was worried about her.
A Supply Chest
In the past, Captain DaVinci Aron led the Resistance to defend the island from the Arkeum Legion, but uneasiness still lingers here. You left Fortress Aron to help Lottie transport military supplies.
Find the Transport Cart
You came across a watchtower that had collapsed after an unusually powerful attack by the Arkeum Legion. The rubble blocked the path, but you and Lottie used a grappling hook and pitons to climb over it. 
Frenzied Mitrans
You defeated the Contaminated Mitrans that appeared where the fireballs landed and then headed toward Whisperion. Fortunately, Whisperion was still intact, but you couldn't help the North Guards because of a broken pulley lift. When you contacted Whisperion, a mysterious being bathed in light appeared and led you to the top of the Great Tree.
Precarious Great Tree
Using Whisperion's power, which reacted with the Star Fragment, you arrived at the top of the giant tree and met Clay, a leader of the Resistance. When you offered to fight alongside him, he said he would explain the operation in Tuaren's Terror. Use Glide Morph to descend and meet him.
Join the Battle for Whisperion
The children who lost everything here ten years ago now fight against the giant orcs of the Arkeum Legion. They were determined never to back down...
The Start of an Adventure
Thanks to the Star Fragment power within your body, the island weathered the crisis. If this power spirals into a frenzy again, it will be dangerous. The wizard, Clay, offered you a solution, saying that he knows someone who can help you control your power and grow stronger.
Arrival in Laslan
Arriving in Laslan, you spoke with the Storage Manager to find out the whereabouts of Clay's friend, Martinay Casill. The Storage Manager said he would not tell anyone looking for Martinay about her location.
Dream You Must Wake Up From
Years ago, the Elder of Whisp Island, Yann Junath, died a heroic death fighting the Arkeum Legion to protect the children. The Star-Born of this island each have mysterious powers, such as the ability to morph, and live in hiding from those who aim to seize that power.
After all these years, the memory of that day returned like a nightmare.
Benny’s Concern
When you opened the door to find Benny, he was very concerned that your nightmares had returned. He suggested that you follow his friend Lottie to Moonshade Town.
Fortress Aron
Whenever Gigantrite visits Whisperion, the town buzzes with excitement and energy. During such an event, you and Lottie left Whisperion's fortress to visit Moonshade Town.
The Bad Omen
The watchtower was destroyed by an attack. Although the path was now blocked, you and Lottie made use of the piton and your grappling hooks to continue onward.
Precarious Great Tree Whisperion
You defeated the Black Mitrans that appeared on your way to Whisperion. While Whisperion was still intact, a broken pulley lift prevented you from reaching Moonshade Town. Suddenly, a mysterious being bathed in light appeared and led you to the top of the Great Tree.
Whispering Amitoi
After arriving on top of the Great Tree, the mysterious being taught you how to use a Glide Morph. Once you descended from the tree, you met Clay, a Resistance leader. He asked for your help protecting the residents from the Arkeum Legion and invading orcs.
Moonshade Battlefield
The child who lost everything here ten years ago, now challenges the might of the Arkeum Legion. Star-Born bravery and determination, forged in celestial fire...
Hello and a Fresh Start
Thanks to the Star Fragment's power, the island is safe for now. However, you learned just how unpredictable, and dangerous, this power can be. Thankfully, Clay has a researcher friend who may be able to help. He arranged a way for you to meet her in Kastleton.
Darkness Incoming
After all these years, the nightmare has returned as a vision.
Benny's Request
At first, Melki pretended not to know anything about Martinay. It turns out, she had gone into hiding, fearing the Arkeum Legion. When you showed Clay's token to the villagers, they told you where to go and gave you the full password: "The Light Fragment whispers."
To the North Guards
You came across a watchtower that had collapsed after an unusually powerful attack by the Arkeum Legion. The rubble blocked the path, but you and Lottie used a grappling hook and pitons to climb over it.
Whisperion in Peril
You defeated the Black Mitrans that appeared where the fireballs landed and then headed toward Whisperion. Fortunately, Whisperion was still intact, but you couldn't help northern guards because of a broken pulley lift. When you contacted Whisperion, a mysterious being bathed in light appeared and led you to the top of the Great Tree.
To the Enemy Camp
Battle for Whisperion
The Beginning of an Adventure
Storage Manager's Advice
In order to prevent the overflow of Mauvessence in your body, you arrived at Kastleton in search of Martinay Casill. Will you be able to meet Martinay here and deal with the mana frenzy? You must first meet with the Storage Manager who knows the village well to determine Martinay's whereabouts.
Find Martinay
The Locked Infirmary
Kastleton Infirmary has been closed for some time due to rumors that the Arkeum Legion was hunting Martinay. It was to trick them into thinking that Martinay, who had worked as a healer there, had left. While in hiding, she is still researching a cure for her sister of her Star Fragment's side effects.
The Herbalist's Gloomy Apprentice
In the apothecary at the Golden Rye Pastures works the always-gloomy Oliver, the herbalist's apprentice. Oliver has been an apprentice there for some time, though he has yet to gain the approval of his master. You've heard that the locals pitied the outstanding apprentice, a gifted student who suffered under his eccentric master.
Recipe for Rancid Powder
After acquiring the last ingredient from the Mandrake Farmstead, you were able to meet the herbalist, Wilson. He always entrusted the apothecary to his apprentice and collected herbs alone. He had to venture to all sorts of dangerous areas to get medicinal herbs, but his pupil was a coward who would flee at the sight of an ant.
Poisonous Wasp Stinger
The Wasp is a mysterious insect that can control the potency of its poison depending on the situation. The poison of their sting also helps control the toxicity within magic. Even poison can be used as medicine depending on who wields it.
Contaminated Scarab Horn
The Scarab's horn, where the creature's life essence gathers, is a highly effective medicinal ingredient. Contaminated Horns heal the parts of the body several times more than normal horns, but with an added risk of poisoning.
The Herbalist's Explanation
After acquiring the last ingredient from the Mandrake Farmstead, you were able to meet the herbalist, Wilson Hinman. He always entrusted the apothecary to his apprentice and collected herbs alone. He had to venture to all sorts of dangerous areas to get medicinal herbs, but his pupil was a coward who would flee at the sight of an ant.
Mana Calming Potion
The Calming Potion that Martinay made worked. As soon as I drank the calming potion, I could feel my magic calming. Martinay, who has been ceaselessly researching to relieve the pain of her older sister, Adriana, finally succeeded in creating a mana calming potion with greater efficacy than the previous ones.
News from Mina
The news from Mina was unexpected. Zaroth's spies were closing in on Adriana's hideout, forcing her flee. Martinay's potion was still not effective enough to control her mana completely, so she set out to find a way to quell her frenzied mana on her own.
Clues Left by Adriana
The Arkeum Legion attacked the lighthouse where Adriana had been hiding, seeking the power of her Star Fragment. Only after defeating them did you discover her research papers and a diary she had left behind. There, she had clearly recorded the difficult times she had been through.
Janice's Advice
You found a document which contained details about Janice Cartair, someone Adriana had met. Janice, recognizing the strength of the Star Fragment that Adriana had, advised her that the only way to be free from the Arkeum was to leave as soon as possible and find a way to control her power.
The Records of that Night
In the past, when Arkeum had taken Martinay hostage, Adriana had unleashed a cursed storm with her powers. When the Arkeum tried to dispose of Martinay, who had served her purpose to them, Adriana lost control of her Star Fragment. She has been suffering from the side effects of that mana frenzy ever since that day.
Record of that night (Added)
Though Martinay was already gone when you returned to the Kastleton Infirmary, Mina was able to pass on her letter. According to her note, Martiney fled town, afraid that the Arkeum Legion would find her. Someday, she hopes to meet you again.
Clay's Achievement: Waypoint
The Einar Priestess, Grace, introduced Waypoints as a great integration of Venelux Magic. Teleportation was a rare skill that was only used by a few wizards. When the wizard Clay completed the schema for Waypoints, it enabled anyone to teleport freely.
Appendix ▶ How to Use a Waypoint
Once you place your hand on a Waypoint, it will glow with blue light, activating the schema. If you open the Map and select an activated Waypoint, you can instantly travel to that location.
Appendix ▶ Developing Weapons
Martinay warned that, even keeping the magic under control with Mana Calming Potions, it was still possible that Arkeum might still find out about the Star Fragment. So you got to work on a weapon to prepare for battle against Arkeum.
The Girl Who Remembers
Ten years ago, a pack of wolves led by Iskale the Gray-Fanged took over the Blackhowl Plains and drove the town into a state of terror. What actually happened the night when the wicked wolf perished? Many people in Kastleton remember what happened back then. Among them is Soiri, a girl who looks to adventurers in the square for help.
The Lord's Aide's Crisis
Dave, the lord's aide, was concerned that the bait he was using for the Wolf Hunting Contest wasn't effective enough. He decided to solve this problem by developing a new kind. To get a Keepsake for Soiri, you must first gather the ingredients for this new bait from Windhill Shores.  
Shipwreck Pincers
Crustaceans called Crackels are often found in the wrecks near Windhill Shores. Crackels are as ferocious as they look and have a pungent smell. It's said that a hunter once won the Wolf Hunting Contest by secretly using Crackel meat as bait.  
Fisherman's Bait
Unfortunate accidents often happen off the coast of Kastleton, when fishing boats are sunk by the perilous reefs. Chunks of the bait the anglers use are sometimes found in the chests that wash ashore from the wreckage. Their pungent smell is highly effective at luring in wolves.
The Relieved Aide
When you returned with the ingredients, the lord's aide was greatly relieved that he could proceed with the contest as intended. He asked you to deliver the new bait to the lord's brother, Chris, in Blackhowl Plains. He also is the Head of the Wolf Hunters Association, so you'll need to talk to him to acquire a Keepsake.
Chris, Head of the Wolf Hunters Association
Although no more Keepsakes were being provided for the Wolf Hunting Contest, Chris, the Head of the Wolf Hunters Association, told you the materials needed to make them and introduced you to a village craftsman. Chris harbored a strong hatred for Iskale, who wielded the Mauvessence and had taken the life of his nephew, Henry.
Proof of Valor
One of the materials for the Wolf Hunting Keepsake is a broken fang from one of the ferocious wolves that inhabit the Blackhowl Plains. Only intrepid hunters can acquire this material symbolizing the death of Iskale the Gray-Fanged.
The Mystical Tomb of Hamel
Another item required for the Wolf Hunting Keepsake is one of the antlers laid atop the tomb of Hamel, Iskale's archenemy. The antlers of the deer who sought their final rest there gleam and glow brightly with Hamel's mysterious powers.
The Help of a Likeable Artisan
Thomas, a Kastleton craftsman, reminisced about the past and recreated the same kind of Wolf Hunting Keepsake he made in times long gone. He vividly remembered the days when Iskale raided his town, recalling that alongside young Henry, who bravely set out to rescue the children, was an unknown hero.
A Girl's Gratitude
After all the twists and turns, you finally gave Soiri the Wolf Hunting Keepsakes you had gathered. She was overjoyed, expressing her gratitude over and over again. Soiri hoped that people would continue to remember Henry for years to come, and told you the location of the abbey where he is buried.
At Henry's Grave
While you were standing over Henry's grave, the spirit of the Divine Beast Hamel appeared. As he used his mysterious power, a vision of the abbey where Henry and Iskale fought unfolded before your eyes. What was Hamel trying to tell you? If you are able to control the dangerous Astral Force, where will your path lead?  
A Hero's Last Fight
Henry, the hero of Kastleton and the young girl's savior, chose to fight against a great evil rather than turn his back, even though he was a mere human. By giving his life to defeat the legendary wolf, Henry proved that anyone could overcome mere destiny with the power of their own will.
A Sincere, Warm Embrace
Standing atop the coastal cliffs of Kastleton, Helpie spent a long while gazing silently towards Whisp Island. Finally, it spoke. It said, "Farewell, until the day we meet again," and wished you well on the path ahead. You ruefully parted from the little friend who had been by your side from the beginning, continuing your journey alone.

Windswept Document
In Kastleton, you found a document bearing the emblem of the Resistance and the signature of the Contract Manager. Is this related to the Resistance members active in various parts of Laslan? In order to return the document to its owner, you must first go to the Contract Manager.
Contract Scroll Delivery
Resistance Contracts are part of a program devised by Captain DaVinci to help those in need. Contract Managers can be found in each town and base. Kastleton Contract Manager Noss has asked you to deliver a Contract Scroll to the Starlight Observatory Ruins.
Appendix ▶ Resistance Contract Coin
Contract Coins, which are only paid to those who complete contracts, are a currency circulated among the Resistance. Resistance soldiers use these coins to purchase special items. In order to keep the supply equal amongst the forces, the Contract Coin Merchant places a limit on the daily number of purchases.
At the Starlight Observatory Ruins
At the request of Kastleton Contract Manager Noss, you met with Ilira, the Contract Manager at the Starlight Observatory Ruins. She said that she could use some help and suggested that you take on a contract.
Resistance Contract: Urstella Fields
You delivered the Contract Scroll to Ilira, the Contract Manager of the Starlight Observatory Ruins, and you fulfilled the contract at her request. You can use the Contract Coins you received from fulfilling contracts to purchase items from Contract Coin Merchants.
The Lakeside Watch Captain
You collected evidence and met Watch Captain Ruffello at Red Moon Lake to convey Rubi's warning. After the incident ten years ago, Ruffello was very protective of anything that involves Arkeum, and when he realized that they were behind this incident as well, he rushed to prepare for battle.
Dangerous Goblins
Rubi, who you met at the Starlight Observatory Ruins, was shouting to warn everyone of danger, saying that the Urstella goblins were on their way to attack.
Collecting Evidence
You defeated Goblin Shamans and discovered a shaman's chest near the Monument Stones in Urstella Fields. It contained an order from the Urstella Clan, which was enough evidence to convince the Watch Captain.
Watch Captain's Promise
Having translated the orders, Ruffello deduced that Arkeum and the goblins were colluding and hurriedly began gathering troops to launch a preemptive strike. 
Goblin's Advice
Rubi was perplexed after seeing the orders. Goblins always write in sets of three sentences, but the last sentence had been torn off and was missing. Rubi said that if you went to find Henson, the former Watch Captain, he would help you find the torn pieces.
An Encounter
Henson's expression hardened after reading the goblins' commands. The One-Eyed Hawk said that the fact the final sentence was torn off meant they were about to carry out the mission. Henson said you must hurry to find the missing sentence. 
Retrieve the Scattered Instructions
On the day of battle, the Urstella goblins tear off the last sentence of their chieftain's orders and divide it up through a special ritual to carry amongst themselves. If you gather all of the pieces, you can complete the missing sentence.
Retrieve the Scattered Instructions (Added)
After learning about the special ritual from the Goblin Agitator, you headed to the Monument Stone where the ritual was held. There, you met Ariella, a researcher disguised as a goblin. With her help, you managed to participate in the goblins' special ritual, and discovered the final emblem.
Decipher the Goblin Orders
The missing sentence said that an elite contingent of Urstella goblins was headed for the Starlight Observatory Ruins. You went back to the ruins to warn the guards of the ominous news. Hearing this, Henson left to assemble troops.
Guard the Starlight Observatory Ruins
On Ruffello's order, only a minimal guard had been left at the Starlight Observatory Ruins. Taking advantage of the lax security, elite goblin troops attacked. Henson's support appeared just in the nick of time, leading to a victory against the goblins.
A True Captain
After being given the armband, Ruffello protested that it truly belonged to someone else. He asked you to deliver it to his comrades, who fell in battle a decade ago. It is time to go and find the resting heroes.
A Night Ten Years Ago
Gestahl and Cisero, Henson's former comrades, performed their duty until the very end. Their honor and perseverance earned them a place deep within the Resistance's hearts.
Appendix ▶ The Bear, the Star, and the Key
After managing to defeat the fearsome Goblin Butcher, you acquired an old key engraved with a bear and a star. The only person you can ask about this is the goblin Rubi, who is at the Starlight Observatory Ruins.
Appendix ▶ The True Purpose of the Key
Rubi said that the key was related to the Urstella Star, which was created through one of the clan's rituals. Rubi told you the location of the Old Goblin Town and said that if you're lucky enough, you would be able to find the Urstella Star.
Appendix ▶ The Goblins and the Urstella Star
The old key opened a chest that contained a sparkling shard. Rubi will know the value of this unusual object.
Appendix ▶ Lucky Day
Luck always finds you in unexpected places. It's no different for adventurers. It's clearly your lucky day when you encounter a Mystic Globe while exploring.
Appendix ▶ Mystic Globes and Mystic Portals
The Arkeum Legion often relied on Mystic Globes and Mystic Portals to move supplies. For the Resistance, they have become as valuable as treasure chests.
Appendix ▶ Ashien's Strange Painting
The painter Ashien had many works depicting the Starlight Observatory Ruins, some of which hid a strange power. It pulled those who carried stars in and transported them to a far-off place. Once there, those bearing stars have the opportunity to enhance their abilities.
Appendix ▶ A Small But Mighty Companion
Adventure Pro Percy, a seasoned Amitoi veteran, told you about adventures available only to Amitoi. Your little friends can now go on their own exciting expeditions.
Appendix ▶ Adventures of the Expedition
Just as Adventure Pro Percy said, your Amitoi expedition team brought back gifts from their successful expedition.
The Terrific Trio's Summon
The Starlight Observatory was a major hub in eastern Laslan, which was frequented by large numbers of Resistance members. Between the goblin hunters headed westward to Urstella Fields and the adventurers headed eastward to explore Carmine Forest, no one paid any attention to the sound of a small Diston in the corner of the observatory square.
Rutaine, the Genius Wizard
Rutaine, whom you met in the forest, was investigating the disappearance of a child from Vienta Village. He said the search area, Carmine Forest, was extremely dangerous, so he was looking for someone to help him collect his Mana Recording Devices, which he had designed and crafted to record the movements of any living beings.
Retrieve the Mana Recording Devices
While Rutaine was busy investigating the monster Morokai's nest, you wandered around the forest collecting the hidden Mana Recording Devices. You fought off the spiders that interrupted you and collected the devices that had been hidden in bundles of spider eggs. With those in hand, you can see if there have been any signs of the missing child.
Results of the Analysis
Rutaine, having analyzed the Mana Recording Devices, confirmed that there were no signs of children in the forest, but also said that he had found orders to abduct children in Morokai's nest. Knowing that the situation was even graver if it was a kidnapping rather than a disappearance, he asked you to inform Robert, another member of the Terrific Trio. He also mentioned that Robert would be looking for the missing child in the Nesting Grounds.
Robert, the Wind Ranger
Robert, who had been investigating the Nesting Grounds, immediately redoubled his efforts when he heard Rutaine's message. He recalled some suspicious areas of the Nesting Grounds, asked you to look for any clues he missed, and then set out on his own. The places that Robert told you about were some abandoned carriages and a suspicious Terror Bird nest.
Examine the Destroyed Carriages
Carriages passing through the Nesting Grounds are often attacked by fierce birds. However, there were signs that suggested that these abandoned ones had not been damaged by beak or talon. When we searched through the seemingly insignificant carriages, we uncovered ledgers hidden inside, the pages of which contained many names of both regions and people.
Investigate the Chief Terror Bird Nest
Inside the nest that Robert asked you to investigate, there was a large Terror Bird corpse, a broken blade plunged deep within it. Could it be the sword of someone who had tried to protect the carriages? The only clue as to its wielder is an unusual pattern engraved upon the blade. Robert might know more about the person who wielded this sword.
The Terrific Trio's Leader, Sophia
Robert realized that this was an Arkeum Legion conspiracy. After locating the children by using a discarded map piece, he asked you to bring the clues to his colleague Sophia in Vienta while he journeyed ahead to the Arkeum hideout to ensure the children's safety. Sophia said she would gather reinforcements and asked you to go and assist Robert.
The Children's Whereabouts
When you reached the Arkeum Legion's hideout, you found clues relating to the kidnapped children. Records of a scheme called "Calanthia's Plan" were written in several documents; there was also a magic circle on the floor used to transport the children away. It seems Robert has already jumped into the magic circle, so you must follow and help him.
Rescue Operation
The Magic Circle led you to the hideout of Zaroth, the Laslan commander of Arkeum Legion. While you were fighting alongside Robert, Sophia came with DaVinci and more Resistance soldiers. You managed to defeat Zaroth and rescue the kidnapped children. DaVinci explained that Kazar was behind all this, and asked if you would join the Resistance in their fight against the Arkeum.
The Resistance's New Hope
Sophia congratulated you on becoming a member of the Resistance. She reflected on what an honor it was to be personally chosen by Captain DaVinci, telling you the tales of her memories of being rescued by him as a child. She also revealed her ambition to create a larger guild in order to have the skills to stand side by side with her hero.
The Terrific Trio's Pledge
Though the Terrific Trio possessed excellent skills and a strong sense of justice, they also endured an unhappy childhood. After Captain DaVinci rescued them, they dreamed of following in his footsteps. Soon after, the Terrific Trio became known as the new heroes of the Resistance.  
Appendix ▶ A Place for Guilds
Sophia informed you about the many guild activities and Guild Bases found in different regions. Guild Merchant Soleil, whom Sophia introduced you to, explained the variety of functions and amenities that a Guild Base contains.
Appendix ▶ The Abyssal Contract
Rutaine called for an investigation into the suspicious energy recently detected within Carmine Forest. You followed the flame spirit that appeared after the witch Circe's defeat and, upon entering Syleus's Abyss, experienced a strange phenomenon known as the Abyssal Contract. He recommended that you put this rare power to good use, as it can only be experienced by those who possess a Star Fragment and in realms touched by darkness.
Appendix ▶ The Terrific Trio's Rival
Sophia expressed regret that you had chosen a different guild, but was glad that you'd gained reliable comrades. Although you may be in different guilds, she offered her heartfelt congratulations and support, saying that you were now both comrades and rivals as fellows of the Resistance.
Appendix ▶ Mysterious Lithograph Book
In Vienta Village, you met Robert, who taught you about the Lithograph Book and its advantages. When you felt watchful eyes upon you, you were quick to chase the spy. A lycan named Baize, a member of the Endless Collectors Association, had been observing you from afar. He explained the Lithograph Book's purpose and requested your cooperation in completing it.

Rumor ▶ The Culprit of the Graffiti
Rumor ▶ My Own Little Refuge
Romea's Request
The unnamed epidemic beginning to spread through Vienta Village plunged this peaceful town into chaos. Residents were expelled to an isolation facility outside of town, and with contact with epidemic patients cut off, relatives waited anxiously for news. A woman named Romea was one of them.
A woman named Romea was crying in Vienta Village and pleaded with you for aid. She explained that she had lost contact with her husband, who had fallen ill with the plague and been suddenly taken away to a quarantine camp. She handed you a letter she had written to her husband and asked you to take it to the Resistance forces helping the sick outside the town.
The Contaminated Belongings
The Resistance forces outside of town have been burning the belongings of epidemic patients. You met a woman wearing a mask that you didn't recognize, but soon realized she was Sophia, one of the Terrific Trio. After doing some work at her behest, you heard that letters could be delivered to the doctor in person and headed to the clinic.
The Vienta Village Clinic
A doctor named Leonardas at the clinic seemed to really dislike visits from outsiders. He permitted you to help once he heard Sophia's name, but all the patients' responses to your questions seemed odd. You asked about the green medicine they all mentioned, and Leonardas immediately became angry and kicked you out.
Night at the Clinic
As Sophia suggested, you snuck into Leonardas's clinic at night and saw an unexpected sight. The patients were gone and the person watching the place attacked you. You defeated him and discovered a journal that contained a plan to fake an epidemic, so as to secretly gather human sacrifices. According to the journal, this Blood Ritual would be held tonight.
News Spreads Fast
You hurried to the plaza to tell Sophia what you had found at the clinic, but she wasn't there. A Resistance soldier in the plaza said Sophia had received a report from an investigator and then quickly gone to the wine storehouse near Vienta Vineyard.
Blood Ritual
You went to the wine storehouse, but you were too late to stop the Blood Ritual. Rutaine said that if you kill the Vampire who attacked Sophia to prevent her from being turned into a Ghoul. To do that, you needed to borrow the Guardian's Pledge belonging to a Vampire Slayer. Stonegard Resistance Leader Jacque Hander had it.
His Name Is Jacque Hander
The leader of Stonegard's Resistance Forces was a cheerful man who felt somehow beastlike. Once you had explained the whole story, Jacque lent you the Guardian's Pledge of legendary Vampire Slayer Ezekiel, but he advised you to find the Pledge Loop containing Ezekiel's memories in the Temple of Sylaveth to strengthen the Guardian first.
Pledge Loop
You acquired the Pledge Loop and learned about Ezekiel's past. Leonardas killed Scarla, Ezekiel's teacher and lover, and Ezekiel became a legendary Vampire Slayer out to have his revenge. As Jacque said, you could tell that the Guardian was becoming more powerful as you traced his life story.
Ezekiel and Leonardas
Ezekiel lost the battle with Leonardas, vowed an oath to get revenge, and became a Guardian. With the power of the Guardian's Pledge, Ezekiel encountered Leonardas again and finally repaid him for what happened to Scarla.
Appendix ▶ The Guardian and the Guardian's Pledge
After Leonardas was gone, Sophia returned to her previous form. When you returned the Guardian's Pledge to Jacque, he told you to keep it as a gift. A Guardian's soul and power are offered up through the Pledge Ritual. The owner of that Guardian's Pledge is said to be able to transform into the Guardian at any time and use his power.
Appendix ▶ Equipment Transfer
You met Robert, who was excited to have a new weapon. He showed you how to efficiently enhance new weapons using the Transfer ability. You followed his advice and created more powerful equipment.
Appendix ▶ About Guilds
When you visited Sophia after she recovered, she introduced you to the Guild and told you about Guild Merchant Soleil. Guild Merchant Soleil, whom Sophia introduced you to, explained the variety of functions and amenities that a Guild Base contains.
Appendix ▶ Guild Coin
You've acquired Guild Coins through your Guild. They can be used to buy useful things at the Guild Shop.
Appendix ▶ Guild Base
The Guild Base, a dedicated space for guilds, provides access to Guild Raids and the Arena, as well as the Guild Merchant and various other vendors.
Appendix ▶ The Romance of Fishing
As Adventure Pro Percy waxed poetic about adventure, you went fishing. Relaxed by the water, you had a unique experience: you were so relaxed, you barely noticed the passage of time.
Appendix ▶ The World of Cooking
The fish you caught made for a scrumptious dish. Adventure Pro Percy recommended experimenting with ingredients. New combinations may open up a whole new world of flavors.
Resistance Intel Officer's Advice
A long time ago, the Resistance members who joined forces with the residents of Stonegard drove out the tyrant Fernan and the Arkeum factions who were exploiting the residents. Peace has since come, but Resistance forces are still secretly working in Stonegard to prevent the frequent incursions of Arkeum factions. In Vienta Village, there is said to be a Resistance agent disguised as a peddler who is on a special mission.
A Resistance spy you met in Vienta Village handed over a letter from DaVinci. The letter said that you must find the Golem's Heart, which has the power of a Star Fragment, before the Arkeum Legion does. First, you must seek out a dwarf called Henderson to get important clues.
Encounter with Henderson Harmon
Henderson recorded his adventures in the form of songs a long time ago. If he ever knew anything about the Golem's Heart, there would be clues in his lyrics. The problem is, he took a bad hit to the head in the past and he said he doesn't remember the lyrics anymore because of it. However, it's possible Cavane, a long-time fan of his, might know.
Meeting Cavane
You met Cavane in the Desert Black Market, but it seems he is too deeply saddened by a recent heartbreak to be of much help. Still determined to woo her, he said he can win his love's heart by giving her a valuable accessory, which requires rare materials in order to craft it.
Find the Desert Materials
The materials for the accessory Cavane wants to craft are Desert Flower Roots, which are found in the Monolith Wastelands, and Cobra Wings, which are acquired by hunting cobras. Naturally, these two monsters are infamous in the Monolith Wastelands for their violent temperaments.
Stolen Silk Scarf
Cavane was delighted to receive the crafting materials and tried to sing you Henderson's song, only to realize he couldn't remember the very important second half. He'd written the full lyrics on a very long silk scarf, but it was recently stolen by the Sandflame Bandits. He said he would give you the scarf if you retrieved it.
Retrieve the Bandits' Stolen Items
The Sandflame Bandits are outlaws who steal from tax carriers and merchants passing through the Monolith Wastelands. They'll happily do anything for money and, because they're always drunk, they do not fear anyone.
Return of a Masterpiece
Upon reading the lyrics, Henderson said he'd heard that Sienna, a comrade of his, had broken the heart-shaped stone into pieces and hidden them away. Apparently, the pieces can be collected and put back together using a device in the Chapel. He told you to remember the following lyrics: "Let's fuse the heart pieces! Three, two, one! The Golem will rise when the heart is done!"
Find Golem's Heart Fragment 1
You hunted all the monsters and collected the ingredients needed for the solution to open the chests, as Henderson instructed. Inserting the ingredients in a bottle and shaking it produced the shiny yellow magic solution he described.
Find Golem's Heart Fragment 2
You found the hidden chest and unsealed it by applying the magic solution. Within it was a fragment of the Golem's Heart. Each of the three fragments is marked with dots that seem to indicate numbers. 
Restoring the Heart
Immediately upon reviving the Golem's Heart, many Arkeum forces rushed in, having sensed the mana waves it created. It was not until after you defeated them all in a fierce battle that Resistance Wizard Sienna Parsons appeared. She helped you absorb the intense power of the Golem's Heart and urged you to use it for good, not evil.
Contents of the Old Bag
There was an old bag on top of the broken golem, just as Sienna said there would be. The old and torn bag seemed to contain many memories shared with someone. 
The Song of the Vienta Dwarves
As soon as Henderson saw the bag, his eyes lit up, like he was seeing an old friend for the first time in a long while. He took an old hood from the bag and began to sing, recalling many memories. A crowd gathered to listen to his performance and, touched by it, gave him a cheering round of applause.
Heroes of Stonegard
Sienna Parsons, Henderson Harmon, and Louie Hayson were comrades who shared many a past mission and adventure. They have since gone separate ways in pursuit of their own dreams, but their stories will live on forever through heroic ballads.
Appendix ▶ The Troubled Stonemason
Ripleck, a Stonemason, seems very worried. He told his friend Jericho that he stunned Chernobog in a single blow. When his friend scorned the notion, they made a bet and he promised to show him Chernobog's Carapace as proof.
Appendix ▶ Dimensional Circle Researcher Paola
You met a wizard named Paola, who had been researching dimensional circles at Vienta Village. She was very grateful when you brought her the last research journal. Paola promised that she would let you know when her research was complete.
Appendix ▶ Dimensional Circle: Roaring Temple
You found a lost research journal in the Roaring Temple beyond the dimensional circle. It holds valuable insights that should be useful for Paola's Dimensional Circle research.
Appendix ▶ Dimensional Circle: Cave of Desperation
You found a lost research journal in the Cave of Desperation beyond the dimensional circle. It holds valuable insights that should be useful for Paola's Dimensional Circle research.
Appendix ▶ Fierce Debate
In Jacque Hander's office, you found DaVinci Aron and Jacque Hander in the middle of a fierce debate. It was regarding the Siege War involving Resistance members and Stonegard Castle. With both sides unwilling to bend, they asked for your opinion on the matter.  
Sandworm Lair Phantom
In the Stonegard desert, the Sandworm Raid Group targets Queen Bellandir, the Sandstorm Overlord. They have continued their struggle against the Queen despite lacking sufficient military might. However, there was someone who could not simply stand by and simply encourage their fight. This was a soul who has been unable to leave the Sandworm Lair for more than a decade.
Queen Bellandir's Tracks
Glenn Richill wanted to dissuade his daughter from trying to hunt down Queen Bellandir. He was well aware of the queen's horror, given that he died after losing his leg to her. Having witnessed the aftermath of Queen Bellandir's work in person, you could understand why he was so worried about his daughter that he was unable to leave this world.
Why You Must Carry On
The investigation team stumbled across Queen Bellandir during their survey, leading her to launch a fierce attack. If it had not been for the wizard Josephine Craft, they might have failed to escape. You then sought out Marcia Richill, Glenn's daughter and Sandworm Raid Group Captain. You tried to persuade her to cease her plan to defeat Queen Bellandir. However, she did not relent.
If She Cannot be Stopped...
When Glenn realized that he couldn't stop his daughter, he decided to help her. He recalled the trap Marcia had prepared and thought that if he could lure Queen Bellandir there, his daughter could achieve her goal without being in danger. Perhaps the wizard Josephine can find a way to help Marcia.
Moonlight Oasis Wizard
Josephine recalled some passages in Clay's book and found a way to lure Queen Bellandir. She also informed you that the source of Queen Bellandir's power was something known as a Star Fragment. Though Star Fragments contain pure power, someone created a monster called Queen Bellandir out of evil intent.
Magic Amplification Gear Materials
You've decided to use Queen Bellandir's attraction to powerful mana to lure her in. Now, in order to create artificially powerful mana, you need to create a lure using Armadillos' Sharp Scales.
Luring Device Mana Source
The Potent Sandworm Poison Sac is also used as a raw material for mana production. It is particularly suitable for a mana amplifier to lure Queen Bellandir because it can be used to freely adjust the emitted level of mana based on external conditions.
Unexpected Variable
The first attempt to build the device for luring Queen Bellandir ended in failure. Since common Elemental Fusion Stones often contain impurities, they cannot be used to contain delicate and complex Schema like the Magic Schema for attracting monsters. Josephine explained that making a Pure Elemental Fusion Stone will make up for this error.
Water for Drawing Magic Schema
Purified water used to draw a Magic Schema is essential to making a Pure Elemental Fusion Stone. This is because low water purity can lead to errors in the schema. In the desert where water is scarce, Cactus Water can be used as a viable substitute.
Sand for Engraving Magic Schema
It is important to consider not only the size of the sand particles used for the Pure Elemental Fusion Stone, but also whether they contain their own impurities. Moonlit Sand Crystals can be ground to very fine particles and are the purest of their kind.
Queen Bellandir Luring Device
Having finished crafting the pure Elemental Fusion Stone, the device for luring Queen Bellandir was complete. After installing the device, you pressed the button of the remote control to amplify the mana emitted and attract Queen Bellandir. The remote control must be operated at a minimum safe distance from the device.
Marcia's Request
Upon learning about the luring device, Marcia wanted to catch Queen Bellandir immediately. However, in order to do so, a full-scale offensive involving the entire Sandworm Raid Group is needed, and most of the troops are already active in the Sandworm Hatchery. Marcia's troops need help to finish the job and return quickly.
Support the Sandworm Raid Group
The Sandworm Raid Group regularly carries out operations to reduce the Sandworm population. Once these begin, all but essential members of the squad remain in the Sandworm Hatchery and only return when the mission is complete. The best and only way to get the squad members to come back is to help them complete their operation quickly.
Marcia's Plans
Marcia and her group had already set up a trap in the hopes of catching Queen Bellandir. Unfortunately, it had proved useless, with the Queen never showing up at it. With the new luring device, however, she could be attracted to the trap and captured as planned.
Prepared Trap
The place Marcia mentioned was filled with bombs and gunpowder chests all meant to kill Queen Bellandir. Even the fearsome beast would struggle to survive if caught there during the blast. The luring device was installed in a chest placed in the center of the trap.
Operation: Defeat Queen Bellandir
After Marcia pressed the button on the remote switch, Queen Bellandir charged. Her fierce attack was cut short when she stopped in the middle of the trap and took flight. Determined to bring her down, the raid group let fly every arrow they had. The enormous sandworm was engulfed in an explosion as the gunpowder chests caught fire, but managed to escape.
Dream Near Fulfillment
Marcia succeeded in critically injuring Queen Bellandir and felt confident that the next battle against her would be the last. When she learned all of this stemmed from her ghostly father's request, she was filled with bittersweet gratitude. Above all, she now hopes her father can rest in peace.
Victims' Stone
A stone engraved with the names of all those killed by Queen Bellandir rests on one side of the camp. This memorial only honors the officially identified victims, so it is impossible to guess how many more fell prey to her over the years.
Miracle in the Sandstorm
Humans only defeated Queen Bellandir once in the past. Among those she devoured that day was Roen, who possessed the power of a Star Fragment. Roen transformed into an ethereal violet phoenix and burst through her tough carapace. This was the first time Queen Bellandir experienced such pain and she fled in surprise.
Appendix ▶ Clay's Book
You can get a glimpse of Clay's interest in the various monsters and poisons of Solisium through his books. These books contain interesting information, such as the fact that the mighty Queen Bellandir was originally a small sandworm, and that Sandworm Poison Sacs have the rare ability to detect another being's mana.
Appendix ▶ Marcia's Picture
The picture that Marcia asked you to deliver to her brother was a sign of her deep and aching longing for her family. It showed her childhood home, where she and her siblings shared many good times with their father Glenn before he lost his leg. After slaying Queen Bellandir, it is Marcia's dream to rebuild the house there.
Appendix ▶ The True Feelings of Two Siblings
The Richill siblings had been estranged since falling out over the question of whether or not to leave their hometown. Upon seeing the picture, however, Mark Richill understood what his sister was trying to say. He immediately set out to write her a heartfelt letter in reply. It seems reconciliation for the siblings might not be far off.
Wasteland Abnormality
The Manawastes, located north of the Sanctuary Oasis, has always been home to dangerous Demonic Beasts. Venelux has set up a Barrier Magic Circle to keep them at bay, but recently, there have been strange occurrences where the ward has been shaken and the Demonic Beasts have raged out of control. Captain DaVinci, the leader of the Laslan Resistance, has asked Venelux to investigate these anomalies and has sent Officer Kaina there to assist.
The Ominous Rift
The Resistance forces at the Sanctuary Oasis were investigating the increasingly common imp lairs when Lukas, a new recruit, found himself trapped in a warehouse by by a stream of imps emerging from a rift. At the request of Resistance Officer Kaina, you rescued him and sealed the rift with the power of the Star Fragments.  
Traces around the Tower
Lukas suspected the Abandoned Tower on Daybreak Shore of being another imp lair. You traveled there on behalf of the injured Lukas. There, beneath the Abandoned Tower, you found the body of a Shadowmancer and a parchment that had been charred black by dark magic.
Atop the Abandoned Tower
At the top of the Abandoned Tower, you touched the Pedestal of the Covenant and a vision unfolded. The vision showed a ritual being performed and the demon Risieth being summoned. After the vision faded, the sealed demon scroll appeared. You should give it to Lukas, who's waiting for you at the Sanctuary Oasis.
Prompt Warning
At Lukas's request, you warned the residents around the Sanctuary Oasis of the demon Risieth's summoning. Priestess Abigail suggested that you meet with Elleia, a mage from Venelux. Elleia has long suspected that the strange phenomena in the Manawastes are of demonic origin.
Old Poem
Elleia, a wizard from Venelux, shared an old poem about demons. She asked you to meet Grudran, a knowledgeable traveling merchant and have him interpret the poem. Grudran recognized the allusion in the poem and told you that the smoke from burning fully bloomed Crimosas could ward off demons.
The Snake Tongue Flower
The Crimosas thrive in The Raging Wilds, but opening them requires the poison from the Tentacle Desert Flower. After opening the Crimosas with the poison, you gathered the necessary ingredients. When you returned with the opened Crimosas, Grudran placed the petals and charcoal in a special censer.
Incense to Identify Demons
Elleia asked you to take the censer and vanquish the demons hiding among the humans. Traveling merchant Omid and new Resistance member Rayton liked the scent it made; strangely, Lukas became distraught and fled. Hurry to catch up with Lukas and discover the truth of his identity!
Lukas's Identity
After much interrogation, the demon hiding within Lukas finally revealed itself. You managed to defeat it, but it was Havres, the Demon of Knowledge, not Risieth, the Demon of Deceit. Chillingly, this meant that more than one demon walked the land. Now you must find Risieth, the Demon of Deception, who's been summoned from the Abandoned Tower.
Havres's Journals
Havres, the Demon of Knowledge, kept numerous journals in his library. The journals revealed that he had been gravely wounded in a battle with Risieth, and that Risieth was pursuing him in human form. He was most suspicious of Elleia, a mage who had recently arrived from Venelux.
The Truth About Elleia
Elleia left the barracks and waited for you in the Hidden Hall. While trying to avert suspicion, she made the mistake of mentioning Havres. In the end, she revealed herself as Risieth and attacked you to get your Star Fragments.
Story of That Day
Shadowmancers summoned Risieth to gain power, only to be destroyed by her. Havres, who was summoned over a hundred years earlier, was mortally wounded in a battle with the other demon over the Star Fragments on earth. These two demons each hid in a human body and devised a plan to defeat each other.
Appendix ▶ Ollis's Request
The barrier that Venelux has set up in the Manawastes must be maintained. If it were weakened, the Demonic Beasts would run amok, leading to its complete destruction. Ollis asked you to help the mages in the Manawastes fortify the barrier.
Reunion
Unusual activity has been detected among the Fonos and Akidu, the giant orc clans with territory bisecting Laslan and Stonegard. Having determined their tendencies, the Resistance began to mobilize to prevent any unexpected accidents. Among them was a familiar Resistance member from the square in Canina Village.
Dangerous Companion
The Guild Leader of the Talon Guild, Arthur Talon, was asking Resistance soldiers to take on special Contracts and giving out generous rewards for their completion. The high rewards indicated just how dangerous those Contracts were. They were particularly focused on investigating the orcs' movements. Even the Fonos orcs of Laslan were included as a target.
Unknown Threat
After infiltrating the Fonos clan for an investigation, you learned that their recent ferociousness was due to tension with the Akidu orcs. The Fonos orcs were trying to gain more strength to fight the Akidu orcs by staging a Festival of Fire.
Investigation in the Flames
To prevent the Fonos orcs from gaining too much strength, you defeated the Chief Priest overseeing the Festival of Fire. The Talon Guild then began an investigation into the priest to obtain more detailed information.
Missing Friend
When you finished your mission and went to report to Arthur Talon, you learned that Benny had been kidnapped by the Akidu orcs. On your way to Akidu Valley to rescue him, the wizard Zarek gave you an Orc Morph Potion, saying that the time will surely come when you would need it.
Benny's Trail
You obtained some information on Benny's whereabouts from a drunk orc. This information led you to a notebook with Benny's name on it and a prison key.
Undercover Investigation
After finding out where Benny was being held, I drank the potion Zarek gave him so I could infiltrate the area. The potion did quite the opposite: It turned me into a Fonos Orc, which induced attacks from their enemy, the Akidu Orcs.
Find Benny
Though imprisoned by the orcs, you were able to escape with the key you found in the valley. You defeated the Akidu orcs and located Benny, who was imprisoned and transformed into an orc. He said that before he could escape, he needed to first return to his original form.
Secrets of the Valley
Deep in the valley, it was revealed that the Akidu orcs had been kidnapping Fonos orcs and using wicked sorcery to turn them into "Shadow Orcs". These living weapons lose all sense of self, unable to do anything but fight to their deaths with unnatural fervor.
Dark Wizard
Zarek, seemingly a wizard of the Talon Guild, revealed his true identity as a member of the Arkeum Legion, who had infiltrated the Resistance. This unfortunate revelation made it clear that Akidu orcs' dark rituals were tied closely to the Legion.
Talon Guild Conspiracy
Another betrayal came when it was revealed that Arthur Talon, leader of the Talon Guild, was working for Arkeum after being bribed by Zarek. You joined forces with Benny to defeat the pair, but the enemy forces were fast approaching.
Escaping the Valley
After narrowly escaping the valley, you informed Gideon, the Watch Captain of Canina Village, about Arthur Talon's true allegiances. However, you needed solid evidence to prove the guild leader's betrayal.
Find Evidence
Following Benny's advice, you searched through the Talon Guild's home and found decisive proof of a conspiracy between Arkeum and the Akidu orcs.
Conspiracy Revealed
With the evidence in hand, Gideon decided to report the Talon Guild's corruption to the Resistance. After everything was settled, Benny bade you farewell, promising to see you under better circumstances.
Flame Consumed by Darkness
Arkeum was behind the Akidu orcs creating Shadow Orcs all along. They even bought off a Resistance faction to help carry out the conspiracy. Though their plot was uncovered this time, you will have to remain vigilant to prevent future catastrophes.
Gift of Motherly Love
The guards of Grayclaw Forest, where the brutal lycan roam, forever stand at the crossroads between life and death. Their families, too, are always on edge. Today in Canina Village, the mother of a guard is looking for an adventurer to tell her news of her son.
Into the Grayclaw Forest
You went to the Watch Guard Post to give Hannah's gift to Harden, but Gustav said Harden had not returned yet. In order to complete your delivery, you went to the Grayclaw Forest in search of Harden.
Find Harden
You found a lost notebook near the Guard Post. It said that a soldier suffering from insomnia went out on patrol in the forest. Based on the notebooks contents, you suspect it belongs to Harden.
Harden's Tracks
Traces of Harden were found in the Grayclaw Forest. He was badly wounded in a bloodbath with lycans, and it seems that he heard a strange noise that led him to the Lycans' Hall.
At the Lycans' Hall
You met Clay at the Lycans' Hall, where he was investigating a series of disappearances. He invited you to join him in his search for Harden. After lifting the lycans' spell, you found someone lying unconscious.
Guild Base in Chaos
At the Guild Base, the search for the missing guild members was a heated debate. The guild leaders confirmed that Harden was the man you found in the Lycans' Hall. Clay asked for help, saying that you could unravel the mystery of the disappearances once Harden regained consciousness.
Material to regain consciousness
A Contaminated Mitran's Spirit can dull the mind, but it can also be purified to help restore consciousness. Clay suggested you search for Contaminated Mitran Spirits and Dawn Weed on Purelight Hill.
Purified Mitran's Spirit
You learned that a Purified Mitran's Spirit can be acquired by purifying a Contaminated Mitran in the Main Waterway. To help Harden regain consciousness, you were told to bring the Mitran's Spirit and Dawn Weeds to Clay.
Awoken Harden
Clay successfully woke Harden with the ingredients he received. According to Harden, the lycans aren't responsible for the disappearances. He said he was drawn to a strange sound, and then a black smoke engulfed him, knocking him unconscious.
Clay's Magic Communication Device
You decided to investigate the Ruins of Turayne to find clues about the missing people. Clay asked you to take the Magic Communication Device, which was still being tested, since it would help you get a sense of what was going on around you. 
Pitch Black Energy
One by one, you found signs of the missing Resistance Soldiers, but no signs of battle or bodies. While the bizarre sounds continued, something black appeared, beckoning you to follow it.
Investigate the Ruins of Turayne
You met Auguist, who was searching the Ruins of Turayne. According to him, the missing people here kept hearing strange sounds, just like Harden. They headed to the Shadowed Crypt, never to be seen again.
Dark Nightmare
The strange black smoke was a gateway to a nightmare. One by one, the Resistance Soldiers vanished as they followed the Mauvessence flickering in the darkness.
Study on Stars and Nightmares
Together with Clay, you investigated the connection between the Star of Sylaveth and the nightmares. According to some ancient texts, those who possessed pieces of the Star of Sylaveth were spiritually connected to each other, sharing sensations and even traveling through time and space.
Assaulted Purelight Tower
As you hurried out of the library, you were greeted by a scene of chaos. The Arkeum Legion had stormed Purelight Tower. You and Clay headed to the top of the tower with Sophia, who had arrived just in time to help drive the Arkeum out.
Rescue Gigantrite
You defeated the Arkeum Legion and freed the divine beast Gigantrite from captivity. The Arkeum Legion was using its power to draw more people into nightmares at Berge's command.
Assemble
You and Sophia hurried to the Shattered Temple to solve the urgent situation, but it had already been taken over by the Arkeum Legion. You decided to join Henson and the rest of the Resistance and try to figure out what to do.
Nightmare Herald
You have defeated Undead and the Arkeum Legion by joining forces with Henson and his men, but the Nightmare Herald Berge appeared and captured the Resistance. To rescue the captured Resistance members, Berge's spell must be broken.
Into Another Dark Nightmare
Together with Henson, you defeated the Arkeum Legion and the Immortus, but Nightmare Herald Berge appeared and overpowered the Resistance. You took over for the immobilized Resistance and attempted to break Berge's spell.
Encounter with the Giant Star
When Berge the Nightmare Herald fell, a portal opened up and Kazar emerged. With the Resistance on the verge of annihilation, Clay remained behind to fight Kazar alone, buying precious time to allow the Resistance forces to escape through the portal. Since then, no one has heard from Clay.
Clay's Trail
The Arkeum Legion has started a war all across Solisium, aiming to take the Stars of Sylaveth. Under DaVinci's command, the Resistance has successfully defended Laslan, but most of Solisium remains trapped under the influence of Arkeum.
Appendix ▶ Vicious Lycans
Observation Post Officer Gustav requested asked you to take care of the Lycans who were threatening the villagers. Now that the lycans are gone, the villagers can live in peace.
Appendix ▶ Mother and Son's Hearts
You went to see Harden's mother, Hannah, but she wasn't there. She'd gone on a trip with her son. Now it seems there would be peace for both of them.
Appendix ▶ Crumbling Industrial City
Auguist asked you to lend a hand by clearing out the Undead. The Ruins of Turayne used to be a trading post before the Undead came, but now it's become a hunting ground for adventurers.
Appendix ▶ Weekly Mission
Appendix ▶ Fishing with Lottie
At the Breezeline Station, you met Lottie, an old friend from Whisp Island. Lottie had left the island to formally join the Resistance. She told you she was in awe of the natural beauty of Herba Village and had recently gotten into fishing. She promised to teach you some of her fishing tips and tricks if you can bring her a Bluegill.
Fishing with Lottie
How to Recognize a Fishing Spot
You decided to try catching a Bluegill using Lottie's advice when Lottie, who had morphed into an otter, arrived at the same lake. She said that she was worried and followed you. After morphing, she taught you how to find out information about fishing spots underwater.
Appendix ▶ How to Recognize a Fishing Spot
Theodor's Research Journal
Near the Wizards' Residence, you happened upon a research record that had fallen on the ground. It seemed to be from the research journal of Theodor. Melvin had been worried about its disappearance, so you decided to collect any you found.
The Scattered Research Journal
The pages of Theodor's journal were scattered all over Herba Village in the most unexpected of places, but through various means, you managed to reach the locations of every one and collect them all.
A Gift for Melvin
You gathered all the lost pages of Theodor's research journal that had been scattered throughout the village and placed them in the box in front of the Wizards' Residence. Hopefully they will be of some help to Melvin.
Appendix ▶ Theodor's Research Journal
The Shrine Guardian's Request
The Shrine Guardian, Novia, told you how the people of Herba Village are struggling to hold traditional wedding ceremonies due to a recent shortage of supplies. The Temple of Einar is doing their best to aid them, so she asked you to go and find Priestess Agnes and offer her your assistance and you readily agreed.
Herba Village's Tradition
The Einar Priestess Agnes asked you to find wind flowers, which are essential for decorating the boat as part of a traditional wedding ceremony. Once you had obtained the wind flowers from the Quietis's Demesne area, which is dangerous on account of the Water Golems there, and decorated the boat with them, everything was ready for a beautiful wedding ceremony. The priestess gave you her sincere thanks.
Appendix ▶ The Scattered Research Journal
Investigating the Temple of Truth
A wizard named Norbert posted a flyer looking for the one who helped seal Deluzhnoa. He was a wizard dispatched from Venelux and he had a special request that only someone powerful could fulfill. It was a mission to retrieve recording devices left inside the Temple of Truth by a wizard named Jeremiah. 
The Truth Jeremiah Recorded
The devices you found scattered inside the Temple of Truth contained recorded images of Jeremiah that appeared like illusions. In the recordings, Jeremiah explained that he had created a light elemental to purify the temple which had been contaminated by dark magic, but due to an error in judgment by the other wizards, the light elemental went out of control and turned into a dark elemental.
The Truth is Out There
When you returned to Norbert with the recording devices you had recovered and explained what you saw, Norbert grew angry, saying he couldn't believe it. Unable to accept that Jeremiah may not have been a traitor after all, he concluded the matter as if it had all been Jeremiah's fault anyway.

Appendix ▶ The Truth is Out There
After you befriended the great tree by collecting contaminated fruits, you were allowed to enter the Holy Tree's Sanctuary to meet Janice. The Holy Tree's Sanctuary is said to be the place where the laws of this reality are not applied.
Appendix: The King Khanzaizin Raid Group
Gale Windheim is worried about the young Resistance soldiers who ventured into the Forest of the Great Tree, proclaiming that they'd defeat King Khanzaizin. You must find the raid group, led by an adventurer named Zekk, and persuade them to return for their safety.
Appendix: The Whereabouts of the Reckless Raid Group
You found Suppression Squad Captain Zeke near King Khanzaizin's lair. He died, blaming himself for being overconfident in his abilities and risking his and his men's lives. As Zeke's last request, you found the bodies of his men and collected their belongings.
Appendix ▶ A Lesson for the Resistance
You told Deputy Commander Gale about the raid group's tragic fate, and he blamed himself for the loss of so many young Resistance members. While it is obvious why King Khanzaizin must be brought down, you'll need great strength and preparation to withstand his might.
Appendix ▶ The Weeping Wolpertinger
The Wolpertinger you met in the forest, Dorong, was crying sadly as he reflected on the mistake he had made during the Passage Ceremony of the Great Tree. To help Dorong, you must participate in the ceremony and guide the Elven souls that have been unable to find rest up to the sky.
Appendix ▶ The Passage Ceremony of the Great Tree
As the Passage Ceremony of the Great Tree began, the elves' wandering souls received the blessing of the World Tree and blossomed as fruits. You defeated the ferocious ogres that were after the fruit and, along with the elemental spirits of the Great Tree, helped the souls ascend to heaven.
Appendix ▶ The Broken Purification Device
The scholar, Azra, told you that the Bitumen Purification Device he had built to purify the swamp had been broken in a Mud Shark attack. He asked you to find the parts that had gone missing. After you searched the swamp and found the missing parts, you brought them back to him and he was incredibly grateful.
Appendix ▶ Swamp Purification Mission
Azra demonstrated how he operates the Bitumen Purification Device and explained that he had to repeat the experiment to improve the device. He asked you to participate in the Swamp Cleanup Experiment Contest if you have time to help him purify the bitumen and get rid of the red fog.
Appendix ▶ The Murdered Adventurers
You heard that the bodies of several adventurers on their way to the Shaderock Mountains had been found in the swamp. As you investigated the truth behind the incident at Officer Petra's behest, you discovered that the adventurers had gone to gather and fish as normal and had been murdered.
Appendix ▶ Arkeum's Secret Operation
The place where the adventurers had died was an Arkeum hideout. A piece of paper bore written orders to secretly transport red bitumen to the Black Anvil Forge. The adventurers had been eliminated because they were witnesses. Once you had put a stop to the transport operation, you brought a bottle of bitumen back to Petra and explained everything.
Appendix ▶ A Gift for Giselle
When you met Giselle again, she welcomed you and said she had been worried about you. Because she could not live in the collapsed cave anymore, she had come to live with Azra. Azra wanted to give Giselle a gift to help her feel comfortable with him, but his suggestion was too outlandish, so you decided you would get him a hairpin to give her instead.
Appendix ▶ The Hairpin that Promises Happiness
When you asked the Accessories Crafter about hairpins, she recommended a Moon Flower Hairpin to you, explaining that they were popular at the moment. You fetched a Moon Flower from Moonface Cliff and gave it to her, and she crafted the hairpin for you. She told you that Moon Flowers symbolize a promise of happiness.
Appendix ▶ Azra's Heart
Azra was pleased when you gave him the Moon Flower Hairpin and said he would give it to Giselle, although it appeared that part of him still wished he could give her his more outlandish gift idea instead. He told you that he wanted to purify the red fog, heal Giselle's arm, and let her play as much as she liked.

Golden Rye Pastures
This region was once the most prosperous in Laslan, overflowing with grain, but after the cursed rain came, it became infested with pests of unusual size. People tried to solve the problem by employing the help of wandering wizards, but their clumsy magic only made things worse.
Windhill Shores
While you search for treasures hidden in ships wrecked by storms and chests that have been drifting, you will encounter the masters of the coastline. From a distance, they look like normal crustaceans. However, when you get close, you'll find they pose a greater threat than you anticipated.
Blackhowl Plains
This vast plain used to be a landmark of the village before the packs of giant wolves appeared. Now, however, it has become a land that even experienced hunters fear. Those who trespass into the realm of savage beasts must prepare to face death.
Urstella Fields
It is said that the seeds of the flowers that grow jewels fell on an unnamed land a long time ago, and as time passed, that place became the beautiful field it is today. Goblins have occupied this mysterious land where gems are produced, and they do not hesitate to slaughter any human who would disturb them.
Carmine Forest
The once-green forest lost its vitality and withered to a darkish red, becoming what it is today. It is said that the Blood Spiders, who became the masters of Carmine Forest, capture any humans who set foot there and sacrifice them to someone.
Nesting Grounds
Red flowers bloom across this beautiful meadow located between Laslan and Stonegard. However, contrary to its appearance, it is home to aggressive creatures such as Terror Birds and Quillixes, which is troubling for the merchants who pass through there.
Purelight Hill
When the war between the Sylavean Order and the Lightbringer Society ended, this place became a vast Land of the Dead. Venelux built the Purelight Tower on a hill in the center of the area and has been attempting to purify and heal the land for hundreds of years.
Ruins of Turayne
Turayne was a town that thrived from trade. However, on the day of the funeral of the great wizard who had devoted his life to their town, the Sylavean Order's Shadowmancers attacked and waged a great war with the wizards gathered there. Now only the traces of the destroyed town and the zombies remain in the ruins.
Fonos Basin
This basin is home to the Fonos, one of the orc clans. The Fonos periodically host the Festival of Fire, where they seek the blessing of the fire god Flamakan to become more powerful.
Shattered Temple
Skeletons and Spectral Wizards in this area wander around the Shattered Temple every night. Rumor has it that they are in search of victims to sacrifice to the ruler of this place, Ahzreil, Grand Elder of the Sylavean Order.
Syleus's Abyss 1F-2F
This place, once known as the Crypt of the Ancient King, started to be called Syleus's Abyss after Syleus, one of Greedal's five disciples, had gone into hiding here. He filled the tomb with Undead and secluded himself in the depths.
This place, once known as the Crypt of the Ancient King, started to be called Syleus's Abyss after Syleus, one of Greedal's five disciples, had gone into hiding here. He filled the tomb with Immorti and secluded himself in the depths.
Syleus's Abyss 3F-4F
Ancient king Cornelius met his end in the underground tomb with his faithful servants who protected him. The honorable soldiers slumbered by the king's side and continued their vigil, but Syleus' evil magic awakened them and turned them into mere guards against invaders.
Syleus's Abyss 5F-6F
The four Elders, who traveled to the Abyss at Greedal's behest, attempted to locate Syleus with their demonic powers, but were unsuccessful. Rumor has it that Syleus lurks in the depths of the Abyss, surrounded by strong barriers, but the truth is unknown.
Shadowed Crypt
This place, which was the tomb of high-ranking Shadowmancers of Sylaveth, is famous for bearing traces of the Grand Elder Belluatan, who researched the secrets of immortality. Even now, it serves as the main base of operations for the Sylavean Order. If they expand their influence, they will become a great threat to Laslan.
Quietis's Demesne
Quietis's Demesne is a land still influenced by the remaining traces of the giants who ruled the world in the past. It has been the source of numerous problems, including the Water Golems created through the effect of its mana, and Deluzhnoa, who became a monster because of Quietis's heart. It could even be said that these problems are gradually becoming the new normal as time goes on.
Forest of the Great Tree
The ogres that occupy the Forest of the Great Tree always put the souls of elves in bottles and make off with them whenever the Passage Ceremony is held at the Great Sage Tree. The ogres commit this crime, which prevents the souls from being put to rest, solely because they think the shining elven souls are pretty. This is causing a major headache for the Wolpertingers.
Swamp of Silence
The Swamp of Silence is a place where only mutant sharks and frogs can live due to the toxicity of the red fog that blankets the area. In order to purify the wetlands, the Resistance is working to eliminate the dangerous monsters there while also supporting scholars conducting research on the red fog.
Black Anvil Forge
After losing his son, Pakilo Naru succumbed to his hatred and rage towards humans, and the Black Anvil dwarves soon began slaughtering them. Pakilo's daughter Bonia eventually became the de facto ruler of the forge after his madness made him unfit to lead. She runs an Obsidian trade with Arkeum, and together they are carrying out some kind of secret research.
Bercant Manor
The daughter of House Bercant, Limuny, possessed outstanding talent, but was not recognized by her father because she was a woman. Her brother was granted the lordship instead, only to cast away his honor by obsequiously pledging loyalty to Arkeum. This made Limuny receptive to the words of a witch, and so in return for the promise of power, she freed Norn Bercant, who was sealed away underground.
Crimson Manor
House Crimson was a noble family renowned for their hunting prowess. In reality, they were an organization of hired assassins. A secret location in the mansion contained a workshop for developing cutting-edge weapons, a lab for experimenting on human bodies, and a monster incubation chamber. However, a mysterious accident freed the demonic beasts and murderous spirits undergoing tests, and, in the end, Crimson Manor was left an uninhabitable ruin.
Temple of Truth
Ever since the elves left, the empire's wizards feared that the knowledge they inherited would be lost due to their comparatively short lifespan as humans. They thus created a secret location called the Temple of Truth and sealed it off, with all their knowledge engraved on stones within. However, the entrance was revealed to the world during Deluzhnoa's frenzy.
Monolith Wastelands
This place was the largest granary in the center of Stonegard, where there was an underground reservoir that spanned the entire Dominion. However, one day, the cursed rain fell and the water source was polluted. And so, the wizards of Venelux cut off the water supply with a giant monolithic boulder to prevent the contamination from spreading. Since then, the area has become barren and turned into the desert it is today.
Abandoned Stonemason Town
Valuable Brown Mica was discovered in the village of the stonemasons who were gathered to construct Stonegard Castle. Fernan, the greedy former lord, ignored the warnings of the masons, and dug up the earth to get that Brown Mica, allowing the subterranean monsters to emerge above ground.
Moonlight Desert
The Moonlight Oasis located in the very center of the Moonlight Desert was formed by the power of the queen, Soren Warnach. People used to visit for the oasis in the past, but these days, they come for the Moonlight Scales you can acquire from the creatures around the area.
Sandworm Lair
In the rocky terrain to the northwest of Stonegard, there is a path formed by a giant Sandworm passing through the rocks. We should exercise caution, since there have been frequent reports of missing adventurers here recently.
Manawastes
It may look ordinary, but it is a dangerous area where many adventurers lose their lives due to attacks from demons and monsters. Merchants in this area are especially cautious about Malakar, who is said to be the eye of Junobote.
Akidu Valley
Akidu Valley is home to one of the orc clans, the Akidu clan. In the process of unifying the other orc clans, the Akidu clan betrayed their people and joined hands with the evil Kazar's Arkeum Legion. Their alliance has resulted in the destruction of the existing order and has thrown the world into chaos.
Daybreak Shore
The huge shipwreck I see when I look down from the Dawn Cliffs is a remnant of a dead pirate king's greed. The wreckage's enormous hull and broad, torn red sails tell of the former glory of the ship's captain, the Pirate King Adelico.
The Raging Wilds
This place used to be a rich forest where elves and Mitrans lived. Humans, who were invited into the forest by the elves, were blinded by their greed and started a war. Eventually, the forest was burned down, turning it into the wasteland it is today.
Grayclaw Forest
The lycans of Grayclaw Forest were not initially hostile to humans. But the humans who appeared one day tried to take the lycans' ancestral land, even attempting to destroy the "Moon Monument" that they had held sacred and acquired power from for generations. Since then, the lycans became hostile toward humans.

Since then, the Lycans became hostile toward humans.
Temple of Sylaveth
At the cliffs beside Stonegard Castle, there is a huge underground temple built long ago. Before the war with the Lightbringer Society, it was the largest Temple of Sylaveth in Solisium. Following the great war, most of the Shadowmancers who were here died, and now only a few surviving followers linger, roaming the halls.
Ant Nest
Here lies the impenetrable fortress guarded by the great Queen Lacune. Even the magical forces of Arkeum could not occupy this place. There is a legend that the power that caused Stonegard to go barren created a giant and cruel queen ant.
Sanctum of Desire
Junobote, who took the throne as the Grand Elder of Sylaveth after acquiring limitless power through asking endless questions, headed for the Sanctum of Desire to summon the Demon of Knowledge from Diabolica. No records show that he made it out alive.
Saurodoma Island
Long ago, lizards crossed the waters to Saurodoma Island and developed intellectually to the point that they learned to walk as bipeds, use tools, and cast magic. Known as reptilians, much about these people remains shrouded in mystery because they hate mixing or interacting with other creatures.
Prelude: Island of the Star-Born
Years ago, the Elder of Whisp Island, Yann Junath, died a heroic death fighting the Arkeum Legion to protect the children. The Star-Born of this island each have mysterious powers, such as the ability to morph, and live in hiding from those who aim to seize that power. Whisp Island has once again become the victim of increasing Arkeum attacks of late, and these Star-Born, having finally come of age, are beginning to step forward to oppose their enemy.
The Arkeum Legion invaded Whisp Island once more. The Star-Born, who experienced disastrous war only a decade ago, bravely fought against the invaders and defended the island. The Star-Born then embarked on an adventure to explore the world to learn more about this mysterious power of the stars. 
Chapter 1: The Tragedy of the Casill Family
In order to prevent the overflow of Mauvessence in my body, I arrived at Kastleton in search of Martinay Casill. It is said that this village, which appears peaceful on the surface, once suffered a terrible incident in the past. Will I be able to meet Martinay here and deal with the mana frenzy?
The cursed rain fell because Martinay's sister, Adriana, was unable to overcome the threat of Arkeum in the past. Since that day, she suffered the pains of Mana Frenzy, and her sister's medicine provided no relief. In the end, she decided to leave hoping to escape the clutches of Arkeum, who sought her Star Fragment. The note she left behind said that controlling her strength was the only way to relieve the torment from the Mana Frenzy.
The Tragedy of the Casill Family
Chapter 2: The Demise of the Gray-Fanged
Ten years ago, a pack of Wolves led by Iskale the Gray-Fanged took over the Blackhowl Plains and drove the town into a state of constant terror. What actually happened the night that the wicked wolf perished? Many people in Kastleton still remember the events of that day.
It was the courage of a young man that led to the defeat of Iskale the Gray-Fanged, who threatened Kastleton. Henry, the lord's son, fought Iskale alone and sacrificed his life to protect the town he loved. The Wolf Hunting Contest is still held in the Blackhowl Plains to honor Henry, the hero, to this day.
The Demise of the Gray-Fanged
Chapter 3: Veterans Never Die
I helped the Contract Manager and began carrying out Resistance Contracts. While carrying out various contracts in many lands from Kastleton to the Starlight Observatory Ruins, I learned that the goblins in Urstella Fields were acting suspiciously. Just what are those Goblins up to?
Ten years ago, Henson, the former Watch Captain, defended the Starlight Observatory Ruins in the battle against Arkeum. The fight cost him his eye and many comrades. Henson blamed himself and resigned from his position as captain. But with the Starlight Observatory facing another crisis, Henson, a veteran of countless battles, charged into battle yet again.
Veterans Never Die
Chapter 4: The Terrific Trio of Carmine Forest
In a corner of the Starlight Observatory square, a Diston similar to Lunar-0 was asking for help. This Diston was left behind by the young wizard Rutaine, who urgently requested I come to Carmine Forest. What could be behind this urgent message?
The Arkeum Legion kidnapped children from all over the country to gain the power of the Star Fragments. You helped the Terrific Trio raid the Arkeum's hideout after a pursuit, joining forces there with the heroic Captain DaVinci. In the end, the children were safely rescued, and Arkeum's plot was once again crushed by the Resistance.
The Terrific Trio of Carmine Forest

Hidden Story of Laslan
Chapter 5: A Sacred Pledge of Blood
The unnamed epidemic beginning to spread through Vienta Village plunged this peaceful town into chaos. Residents were expelled to an isolation facility outside of town, and with contact with epidemic patients cut off, their relatives anxiously waited for news. Where did this mysterious plague begin?
A dark truth lurked behind the Vienta Village epidemic. The Vampire Leonardas, disguised as a kind healer, spread the false epidemic to sneak away patients for a terrible Blood Ritual. Sophia was also in danger of becoming a Ghoul, but the power of the Vampire Slayer Ezekiel imbued in a Guardian's Pledge was able to save her. Guardian Ezekiel was Leonardas's old foe and was finally able to get the revenge he hadn't achieved in life through the magic of the Guardian's Pledge.
A Sacred Pledge of Blood
Chapter 6: The Song of the Vienta Dwarves
A long time ago, the Resistance members who joined forces with the residents of Stonegard drove out the tyrant Fernan and the Arkeum factions who were exploiting the residents. Although there is peace now, Resistance forces are still secretly working in Vienta Village to prevent the frequent incursions of Arkeum factions.
In the past, Sienna Parsons and her companions brought a giant Golem to drive a tyrant out of Stonegard Castle. The Golem's Heart, which the Arkeum Wizards sought, was the power source that moved that giant Golem long ago⁠—it was a Manastone that bore the power of a Star Fragment.	
Chapter 7: The Sandstorm Overlord
Under the dim light of the Sanctuary Oasis stands the spirit of a man with a worried expression. He was once a warrior who fought bravely to protect his home from Queen Bellandir, the Sandstorm Overlord. However, his sole aim now is to prevent his daughter from taking up his mantle in the battle versus Queen Bellandir. Just how terrible a monster is Queen Bellandir that a dead father's soul feels the need to remain here? 
Up to that point, Roen Aron was the only human to ever defeat Queen Bellandir. But now a new name would have to be added to the record. Marcia Richill, Sandworm Raid Group Captain, successfully lured in Queen Bellandir and dealt her a deadly blow. Behind her success was a man who worried about his daughter, even after death, and the member of the Resistance who aided his cause.
The Sandstorm Overlord
Chapter 8: The Demon's Smile
In the Manawastes, the Sanctuary Oasis, Venelux's barrier and the vile mana emanating from the Sanctum of Desire were at an equilibrium. However, the barrier has become unstable as of late, making the Demonic Beast more vicious. Venelux has begun investigating, considering these incidents as a precedent of the Demon's appearance.
In the Manawastes, the main site of the anomalies, the forbidden conjuring techniques of Shadowmancers have been found. Demon Risieth, the Demon of Deceit who has been summoned from the Diabolica, possessed Wizard Elleia's body, and started controlling people with her honeyed words. Her goal was to defeat Havres, the Demon of Knowledge, and take the fragment of the Star of Sylaveth for herself. Thanks to her deception, I was taken advantage of and almost lost my life. In the end, however, I managed to defeat Demon Risieth.
The Demon's Smile
Chapter 9: A Pact of Fire and Darkness
Unusual activity has been detected among the orcs of Fonos Basin. The Talon Guild, which is highly reputed in the Resistance, was the first to unearth the orcs' plot. Many Resistance members have applied for this exceptionally high-paying mission.
The Akidu orcs used dark magic to expand their clans, and it was Arkeum who spurred them on. Solisium was once again embroiled in a far-reaching conspiracy.
A Pact of Fire and Darkness
Chapter 10: Nightmare Déjà Vu
I received the urgent request from Hannah to deliver a gift to her son, a member of the guard. However, nobody knew his whereabouts. In fact, there have been a series of disappearances among Resistance members recently... Where could they all have gone?
The Arkeum Legion took people with Star Fragments through nightmares to create a Giant Star Fragment. Kazar hindered the Resistance's escape, but they managed to escape thanks to Clay's sacrifice. We still need greater strength to fight against Kazar.
Nightmare Déjà Vu
The Moonlight Oasis located in the very center of the Moonlight Desert was formed by the power of the Archwizard, Soren Warnach. People used to visit for the oasis in the past, but these days, they come for the Moonlight Scales you can acquire from the creatures around the area.
The huge shipwreck that can be seen when looking down from the Dawn Cliffs is a remnant of a dead pirate king's greed. The wreckage's enormous hull and broad, torn red sails tell of the former glory of the ship's captain, the Pirate King Adelico.
At the cliffs beside Stonegard Castle, there is a huge underground temple built long ago. After the great war with the Lightbringer Society, most of the Shadowmancers who were here died, and now only a few surviving followers linger, roaming the halls.
Here lies the impenetrable fortress guarded by the great ants. Even the magical forces of Arkeum could not occupy this place. There is a legend that the power that caused Stonegard to go barren created a giant and cruel queen ant.
Junobote, who took the throne as the Grand Elder of Sylaveth after acquiring great knowledge through endlessly asking questions, headed for the Sanctum of Desire to summon the Demon of Knowledge from Diabolica. No records show that he made it out alive.
This island, barely visible beyond the Daybreak Shore, is littered with shipwrecks and is also home to the Saurodoma Clan. Members of this clan are rarely seen on the mainland, preferring to reside in their secluded island home. They thoroughly reject incursions by outsiders.
At the Quietis's Demesne, traces of the giants who ruled the world in the past remain, still having an impact. That impact has caused many problems, including water golems and Deluzhnoa, who has become a monster.
On the day of the mysterious incident, the monsters that poured out of the Crimson Manor House infected the manor's inhabitants and animals alike, turning them into mutated abominations. The once bustling village and bountiful ranch are now desolate ruins, and Immorti and other monsters are on the loose, hunting for adventurers.
Ever since the elves left, the human wizards feared that the knowledge they inherited would be lost due to their comparatively short lifespan as humans. They thus created a secret location called the Temple of Truth and sealed it off, with all their knowledge engraved on stones within. However, the entrance was revealed to the world during Deluzhnoa's frenzy.
Limuny, the descendant of Leon Bercant who founded the Spineflower Royal Guards, gained the power of cotton mana for freeing Norn, who became a monster. Limuny transferred the power to his men, but they turned insane due to the power of the mana.
In the past, Crimson Mansion was known for its residents, members of the Crimson House, as they were well-known nobles, and a competent hunting family with a huge garden. However, in truth, the mansion was a secret base and a laboratory for the family of assassins. Due to an unknown incident, it has been completely destroyed. Currently, only dangerous mutants roam in the area.
Specter's Abyss
An intricate labyrinth, Syleus's Abyss is where Heliber, the Guide of the Abyss, leads trespassers to their deaths. The Arkeum Legion continues to send troops into the Syleus's Abyss, often at great cost to themselves, to claim the dark power that fills it.
Roaring Temple
Temple of Sylaveth looks like a large temple from the outside. However, beyond the dimensional circle made by Belluatan, countless dark magic experiments and researches were conducted in secret. The monks voluntarily became Undead with their belief in the goddess of death Sylaveth, and pledged their absolute obedience to the order's Grand Elder. One of their researches aimed to create a biological weapon through dark magic, that is, to create a powerful monster.

One of their researches aimed to create a biological weapon through dark magic, that is, to create a powerful monster.
Cave of Desperation
Equipped with the power of a star shard through the experiments of the dark sorcerer Skultus, Lacune bred giant ants to flourish in her anthill. When this threatened the safety of the Stonegard, the adventurers set out to eradicate the anthill, and eventually Lacune carved out a kingdom of her own in an impenetrable space. Imbued with her magic, it is a place of deadly toxicity, where no one is safe.

Imbued with her magic, it is a place of deadly toxicity, where no one is safe.
Tyrant's Isle
A powerful magical tornado is swirling around Saurodoma Island. It is the work of the Saurodoma Clan's leader, the reptilian Toublek. Those caught in the vortex are taken to another island he has hidden away. He uses the abductees as subjects for his magical experiments, searching for a powerful force that will restore him to his original form.
Butcher's Canyon
King Verte, a giant orc created by the Akidu clan, was a powerful but uncontrollable double-edged sword. Chieftain Tuaren began another experiment to make up for its weakness, and finally created the perfect test subject, Duke Magna. This deadly weapon, sincerely obeying orders with a strong killing power, thirsts for the enemy's hot blood deep in the Butcher's Canyon.
Cursed Wasteland
Elemental Spirit of Light was trapped in the Ancient Temple and disappeared. Then, it was revived by the devotion of a wizard, being given the name Shaiki. However, dark magicians who found Shaiki, kidnapped it and turned it into the Dark Spirit, Shaikal. Shaikal, forgetting everything, is bound to the Cursed Wasteland, breathing the Bloodlust.
Death's Abyss
To gain control of the Syleus's Abyss, the Arkeum Legion succeeded in subduing the Guide of the Abyss, Heliber, and imprisoning him in a sarcophagus. However, once trapped in the sarcophagus, Heliber reemerged as a more powerful Karnix. Since then, Karnix has created an Abyss of his own, trapping all of his enemies in it, but Arkeum continues their attempt to take control of the Abyss, using a variety of schemes.
Temple of Slaughter
Belluatan, the leader of the Sylavean Order, believed that when the world teetered on the edge of chaos, the goddess of death would appear and save them. One of the ways he used dark magic to bring about that chaos was to unleash monsters. Once these powerful creatures were released, the lab turned into a horrific killing field.
Cave of Destruction
Empowered by the power of the Star Fragment, Lacune gained even more magical power as she devoured those who invaded her kingdom. She has since mutated into an advanced entity known as Lequirus, and reigns as the new lord of a vast anthill. Filled with a deadly poisonous aura, Lequirus's hive does not allow intruders to enter easily.
Island of Terror
After performing countless horrific magical experiments to recover his original appearance, Toublek obtained great power, but at the cost of his sanity. Having forgotten his original goal of becoming an Elf once more, he turned into Kertaki the Mad. Now, the Tyrant Kertaki rules Saurodoma Island with an iron fist. As every nightly massacre devours what little remains of Kertaki's reason, soon the entire island will succumb to its cruel ruler's madness.
Voidwastes
The trapped Dark Elemental attracted beings from Diabolica to slaughter humans. Seeing this, the Shadowmancers performed yet another powerful dark magic to fully gain control over Shaikal. However, that only caused Shaikal to turn into Shakarux, an unapproachable being of pure darkness. Now, there is only empty death in the Wastes.
Valley of Slaughter
Tuaren was curious to see how strong his test subjects could become. When Tuaren drained the power from all of his spare test subjects and injected it into Duke Magna, he gained strength beyond the limits of his body. Now, Duke Magna is Turka, a supremely powerful being who slaughters anyone who enters the valley.
Carmine Rage Island
Gaitan, King of the Goblins, and his followers fought against the humans who despised the goblins. In a fierce battle fought in the fog, many humans were slain, their blood spilling into the sea and causing red waves to roll around the island for a time. In honor of this day, Gaitan dubbed themselves the Bloodwave Clan and wiped out the remaining humans. Carmine Rage Island, ruled by Gaitan, remains off-limits to humans to this day.
Torture Chamber of Screams
The Arkeum Legion collaborated with the Sylavean Order and created a torture chamber in the Shadowed Crypt to extract information that would break the Resistance. The horrific torture that took place there provided the Arkeum Legion with vital intel and the Sylavean Order with useful subjects for their research. Now, the Shadowed Crypt echoes with a disturbing cacophony of blood-curdling screams from the dead and the living alike.

Time to build a snowman!
Oh, it's cold! It's going to get all wet!
My mom worries about the sand and dust when I play outside, but I don't mind.
I'm so bored... I'm tired of playing in the sand.
Why can't we play at night?
Wow. What's this? It's cold.
Let's go around one more time while it's raining!
I got told not to play during the day because it's too hot.
I used to play at the lighthouse a long time ago, but I'm not allowed there anymore because it's dangerous.
Whoa! There's a new ship.
(Yawn) Huh? No! I'm not sleepy yet!
Kids! Let's build a snowman!
When will it stop raining?
How could that happen?
The Rye Field Sentry! It's my first time I actually met one.
Wow! Would you let me touch your weapon?
How can I join a guild?
So this is an Amitoi... I've never seen one before.
Have you heard of {gva_LevelRankerNames0}? That's the name of the best adventurer.
When the Harvesters turn into monsters, it's so scary. Why do they change like that?
They say it's a good year for rye, but what does that mean?
I hope I don't meet any wolves.
Daddy! It's snowing again!
Wow! You're really strong.
There's a festival going on now. Aren't you coming?
Mommy! It's raining!
Why are you here? My mom told me to beware of strangers.
Even the sandstorm can't stop me!
Why can't I play all night long?
Huh? It snows here, too?
I hear {gva_CastleOwner_Windawood} owns a castle.
Mom said they raised the tax rate. What's that?
P-please don't kill me.
You're the Sandstorm Warrior, right? That's so cool. Can you take me on your next adventure?
Your weapon... It's glowing!
You're part of the {gva_PcGuildName} guild? Do they let children join, too?
I wish I had an Amitoi.
I heard {gva_LevelRankerNames0} is the best! Someday, I want to meet that adventurer.
Whoa! It's raining! It's so refreshing!
Do you know how to play the scorpion game? What about the desert flower game? Ugh. You're no fun.
Hmph. I want to play in the rain, but Mom won't let me.
Let's play just a little bit longer!
There are white flakes falling!
The {gva_CastleOwner_Windawood} guild occupied Stonegard Castle! Or so I hear.
The tax rate? My mom said it's very important.
I love when it rains!
Our village is the famous Canina Village!
Isn't our village so pretty? I love it.
I'll get in trouble if I'm late.
Will it get cold if it snows?
Huh? I didn't see anything! I don't know anything!
The Full Moon Reaper! It's an honor to meet you.
What's the name of your weapon? It looks so cool.
Are you in the {gva_PcGuildName} guild? I don't know much about guilds, but that one's famous, right?
Oh, my goodness! An Amitoi! Can we be friends?
I heard {gva_LevelRankerNames0} is the best in Solisium. Is that true?
I can't play outside when it's raining...
Adventurer, where did you come from?
Want to play hide-and-seek with me?
Mom won't be happy if I go home too late.
I want to have a snowball fight with my friends!
I love rainy days!
Whoa! Look at the sky!
I'd love to play in the puddle!
Holy cow, look at this weapon! Can I touch it just once?
I want to be as famous as you in the future!
I want to be as strong as you in the future!
I want an Amitoi that cute, too!
A friend of mine said that horned fairies live in the Swamp of Silence. Is that true?
I heard this is all the rage these days.
Who wants to be my friend?
This is the best place for stargazing!
More snow! I want more snow!
No... I guess I can't take a walk today.
Isn't our village beautiful?
I want to play at the port today.
Huh? It's already nighttime?
I forgot why it snows... I should ask my teacher again.
They say it rains when the heavens are sad.
Welcome to our village.
Anyone want to play in the sand? Come here!
I heard there's a bird that cries sorrowfully every night.
Rain, rain! Pour some more!
Are all the other villages this hot?
You're not from this village, right? I knew it.
I have to hurry up and get back home! My gift arrived.
What? It's already night? I didn't get to finish my homework.
I'm going to need some gloves.
I didn't see anything...
Wolf Slayer! When I grow up, I want to join the Wolf Hunting Contest.
Wow! That's a cool weapon. Can you tell me where you bought it? I want to ask my mother to buy it for me.
How old do you have to be to join the {gva_PcGuildName} guild?
It's an Amitoi! Want to come over? Let's go!
Can you let me in on your secret? I want to become strong, too.
No... My new clothes from mother are all wet now.
This village is perfect except that it barely has any books. 
Do people in other villages read a lot of books too?
I'm going to read with the lamp lit up.
I heard that the {gva_CastleOwner_Windawood} guild has occupied Stonegard Castle.
What was it again? Oh! The tax rate! I've read that it's really important.
Mother... Father... 
I only read about the Sandstorm Warrior in books... I never thought I'd get to meet you in person.
Where do they sell those weapons? I want to ask my mother to buy one for me.
Can I join the {gva_PcGuildName} guild, too?
It's an Amitoi! Hello! Can we be friends?
I know that {gva_LevelRankerNames0} is the best warrior in all of Solisium.
I should have listened to my father and gone home early.
Do you have anything to eat?
Mommy... I'm hungry.
I'm hungry...
I'm cold...
Mommy... It's so cold...
I'm sleepy.
I'm tired of playing in the sand...
I want to sleep in a house...
The sky looks weird...
I should collect some water to drink...
Everyone moved away. Now I barely have any friends left...
I'm going to keep playing until it's late.
Hello, snow...
The rain keeps falling...
When will this heal?
I want to make a snowman... but I can't because of the pain...
I feel strangely cold...
I don't want to take any medicine...
Ugh... My stomach hurts...
I'm not feeling well... maybe it's flu?
I wonder where all the fun is. Where should I go?
Have you traveled a lot?
I came all the way over here but I still have to go home when the sun sets.
What should I do when it snows?
No! I hate rain!
This place is for the Resistance, right?
My mom said she'll let me know when our next destination is set.
I think I'd rather go home than stay here.
Whoa. It snows here, too?
I heard the ocean becomes wilder when it rains.
I heard Laslan used to be a scary place... Now it seems to be okay.
Have you sailed on a ship before? It's so much fun.
I heard wolves roam around this area at night.
I wish I could play in the snow.
My mom told me to wear my raincoat.
Is it always this hot here? Maybe it's because it's a desert.
It's so hot... Next time, I hope we go somewhere cold.
Why can't I keep playing outside?
Wow. I didn't know it snowed here, too.
It still feels dry, even though it's raining.
Studying isn't as easy when you're my age, but I'm still committed to doing my best.
We're lucky Yann Junath is still here. I wonder what will happen from now on...
The Wizards of Laslan have a lot of pride. They never back down and always fight back.
Maybe the attack power can be improved by using extreme opposites like fire and water... Oh, I'm sorry. I was talking to myself.
I can navigate this waterway with my eyes closed. Don't worry.
How far are we? If you're bored, take a walk around the deck.
This ship is headed to Laslan - a place famous for Captain DaVinci.
Stonegard is famous for its wine. It's very pricy, though. 
Hello. Can I help you with something?
Do you need something?
Phew... The day goes by so fast.
I'm worried because the roads get slippery when it snows.
Did my child take their raincoat today?
The sun set already? Why is it so dark?
What's going on all of a sudden? It's not even nighttime yet.
What's with this sudden rain?
Thanks to DaVinci, we can all sleep soundly at night.
I still have nightmares of the Arkeum every night.
I should hurry on home.
The ground has turned mucky because of the snow!
Rain? I'm just glad it's not snowing.
People are going to get heatstroke from the sun. You should be careful, too.
I've been busy all day.
It's finally cooling down.
Snow? What's going on?
I should collect some water while it's raining.
We're all going to burn to death at this rate.
It's a miracle that there's peace now in Kastleton. War, contaminated rain, wolf attacks... We've been through quite a lot.
Where did you say you're from?
Last night, my son had a nightmare where a wolf ate him alive.
I'm so tired. I should go home.
I like to see the snow fall down. The only problem is that it piles up.
It's raining quite a bit. Well, at least its good for my crops.
Are you really a murderer?
So, you're a Lobster Maniac! Aren't the lobsters on Windhill Shores so ferocious?
If you join a guild, going on adventures will be much easier.
It must be nice to have a dependable Amitoi!
Oh, my! It's ^<c=@MK_D_Dialogue>{gva_PcName}^</c>! I never thought I'd ever see you in person!
I noticed you from far away. You have such great style.
Welcome to the Golden Rye Pastures. How can I help?
This is the biggest farm in all of Laslan.
It's dark. I should hurry home.
I have to clean up the snow again.
Phew... I don't have to water the crops.
It's great that the Resistance is protecting our rye fields!
What's the name of that cute doll that's following you?
Your clothes look a bit thin. Be careful not to get stung by a bee.
My child really admires you, ^<c=@MK_D_Dialogue>{gva_PcName}^</c>.
There are so many people here these days. I wish things stay this way.
The vineyard is the pride and joy of Vienta.
Would you look at the time?
It's snowing?
I hope the waterway doesn't overflow. But I guess the more water, the better.
How can you kill a fellow Resistance soldier?
You got back alive from the Sandworm Lair? You're no ordinary adventurer, are you?
You're hot too, right? You're just acting like you're not.
A Resistance soldier without a guild? My, how things have changed.
Is that an Amitoi following you? That's the coolest one I've ever seen.
^<c=@MK_D_Dialogue>{gva_PcName}^</c>? I've heard a lot about you... You're famous, right?
If you're wearing tattered clothes, people won't believe you're skilled. I speak from experience.
You're in the {gva_PcGuildName} guild? Please take good care of our village!
I don't know how I'm going to survive with these taxes...
Are you looking to buy something? Don't ask me. Go find a merchant.
I'm so tired today.
I should go home. I didn't realize it was so late.
It's snowing? That's interesting.
I hope it rains a lot.
Someone, catch this murderer!
The Pirate King? Isn't that just a legend?
Now we have Demons? How am I going to sleep at night?
That's a great Amitoi you have there.
^<c=@MK_D_Dialogue>{gva_PcName}^</c>? I heard the Resistance talking about you. Are you really that strong?
I feel safe knowing that {gva_PcGuildName} is protecting Stonegard.
Life isn't too difficult, thanks to the lord's grace. The lower tax rate is much easier to swallow, too.
This village once prospered as a trade route long ago, but it's become pretty deserted after the war. 
Why is it so hot?
I can hear wolves howling from somewhere.
Does it really have to snow?
I wonder if my child is staying out of the rain.
How are people like you not kicked out of the Resistance?
Someone once told me the Akidu orcs never grow weary, no matter how much they fight.
People say the start of a life of adventure is joining a guild.
Your little friend looks a bit tired.
Is it really you, ^<c=@MK_D_Dialogue>{gva_PcName}^</c>? Please, take good care of Canina Village!
You're really frugal when it comes to your clothes, aren't you?
The lycans are preparing another evil spell in Grayclaw Forest. Have you heard?
It might be safe within the castle walls, but there are lots of scary monsters outside. Be careful.
I didn't know there was such a big castle in Laslan.
Thank you for working hard, even at this hour.
It's snowing? What's going on...?
May Einar bless us!
I can't believe a murderer is roaming free inside the castle...
I know of a guild. Want me to introduce you?
My child dreams of becoming as strong as you, ^<c=@MK_D_Dialogue>{gva_PcName}^</c>.
I hear there are artisans who will craft weapons if you just give them materials.
Please take good care of Stonegard Castle.
What's the point of working? I'll have nothing left after the taxes, anyway.
Without the lord, there wouldn't be a Kastleton.
Lord Hobs is highly respected by the people in Kastleton.
When the rain stops, I'll have to clean up around the Lord's Residence.
The lord works for everyone's safety until it's a dark night.
Vienta is safe because the Resistance protects us!
I heard that cobras are rampant outside the town these days, so I'd better buy some snake-repelling herbs.
It's finally raining after so long. It feels so nice and cool.
Hey, look at the stars in the sky.
Hmmm, I think it's a bit cheaper over there...
You have to look carefully when buying something.
Ah, things can't get wet.
Doesn't matter if it gets dark. I know every corner of this place.
Should I buy some dried meat to snack on?
I need to go get some fresh fish.
Oh, my god, is it raining? Well, that should get rid of all the dust.
It's pleasant when the wind blows at night.
As I get older, I keep forgetting things.
Mm... Did I lock the door before I left?
I'd better get to bed, so I can get up early again tomorrow.
Since I slipped in the snow once, I get anxious every time it snows.
What do I do? I think I left a window open!
Oh wow, a solar eclipse!
I can't believe it's pouring so hard...
Oh, wow! Your skills must be as good as your equipment!
Oh my goodness, I can't believe I'm seeing the famous adventurer here!
Oh, you're the famous adventurer. Ho, hoho...
You've got such a pretty Amitoi. May I hold it?
Did you hear that? A spiky monster has appeared in the Swamp of Silence!
Where did the kids go? They never listen when I need their help.
Farmers need to get up at the crack of dawn.
The sun has set already? But I still have so much to do...
I should cover up the food Storage so it doesn't freeze.
Goodness! I better take down the laundry.
Huh? Did the sun set just now?
Just a few years ago, we were all starving to death. Now we're living a pretty good life.
There's no end to all the work that needs to be done at a farm.
I should finish up soon.
Twisting straw into a rope, sewing quilted clothes... There's just too much to do.
I won't need to carry around my water jar today.
Oh, no! I have to collect the grain I left out to dry! 
Looks like a huge storm! Be careful!
Seed Storage is not as easy as you'd think. There aren't many seeds that are as good as the ones from Stonegard grapes.
Oh, my back.
I hope the kids got home safely.
This is the worst time for snow... This is terrible.
If it rains too much or too little, it's a problem.
It's a rain shower.
Look at the wind! All the grapes are going to fall off!
I just can't farm in peace ever since the Harvesters started running about.
Are you here for a contract?
Maybe I should call it a day...
All the wheat will freeze... What should I do?
Rain is crucial for a bountiful harvest.
What luck! It's raining!
Goodness, the sky...!
Oh, dear. This weather...
These grapes are the pride and joy of Vienta.
Good wine is great for the body and relaxing for the mind.
Welcome to Vienta Vineyard.
Wine is the greatest invention of mankind. Don't you agree?
Are you in the Resistance? How are you faring with the contracts of Vienta Village?
Wine is a necessity for travelers crossing the desert.
Today was another busy day...
With this weather, the prospects for this year's yield would be...
I have to record precisely how much rain falls.
I swear it was sunny!
Look! The sky turned red like wine!
The wind is too strong!
Fish is good. Delicious grilled, delicious steamed!
How many fish shall I catch today?
I can't believe it's already been this long. Time flies when you're fishing!
It's snowing. Frozen fish doesn't taste as good.
Gah, it's raining. It's hard to catch fish on a day like this.
Oh my, what's wrong with the color of the sky? Is it okay to fish today?
Good grief, where did all the rain come from?
I've fished equipment like that before and sold it for a pretty penny.
Whoa, who knew I'd see a celebrity out fishing? It's an honor to meet you!
Oh, what's a famous adventurer like you doing in my village?
Such a cute Amitoi! It'd be nice to catch something like this.
I'm on duty. What is it?
If it's not urgent, please don't roam around.
Hmm... Sudden rain is no good.
Someone must have used magic. You should avoid the rain.
Our duty is to protect Laslan.
Don't walk around at night, You'll just look suspicious.
This place is guarded by the Stonegard Civil Guard.
It's nighttime. Please don't roam around.
This is where we monitor the Fonos orcs.
What is it? Don't wander around at night scaring people.
Nobody knows what might happen here. Be careful.
Beware of the undead around here.
I'm patrolling the plains.
Don't underestimate the wolves. They're dangerous, even if they're sleeping.
I'm on duty right now.
It's best not to roam around without cause at night.
I'm patrolling the area around the dungeon.
Be careful. You never know what's going to happen.
The contracts in Stonegard will be quite a challenge.
It's better to go rest at night.
What is it? It's currently all clear at the castle.
Don't interfere with my guard duties.
Welcome to Canina Village.
It's best to go rest inside instead of wandering around at night.
What's going on here?
What's happening?
Are you hurt? If you are, don't hesitate to tell me.
Even if you're not physically hurt, you can talk to me if you're having a hard time.
I should prepare a thick blanket.
I should set up some rain covers.
During the war, we had a shortage of medicinal herbs because there were too many patients.
Is there anything else for me to do?
I hope the roads don't freeze.
I hope they cleared everything that was outside.
Life strikes us with unexpected luck and misfortunes. A wise person should be prepared to embrace them both.
Did I give out all the medicine?
This snow seems ominous.
I would advise against drinking collected rainwater without proper purification.
Oh, hello.
I only want to ease people's pain.
I like to practice healing spells at night. It helps me focus.
Uh-oh, it's snowing. I'd better be careful not to slip.
If only I could harness the enhanced power of water for healing...
Isn't it a little spooky when the sky turns red like this?
Some people have the power of rain at their disposal.
That's some tough-looking equipment. If only human bodies were that strong...
Hunting is always enjoyable!
Don't get comfortable with the beasts. They'll eat you alive if you let your guard down!
The beasts have better night vision than us, so you should be careful if you're going hunting.
What's with the weather? I don't like it.
This is no ordinary rain!
What is this rainstorm? Did someone cause it with magic?
Competition is strong in the Wolf Hunting Contest.
I've come a long way just to join the Wolf Hunting Contest!
You should go inside and rest at night. Don't underestimate the wild animals.
I should take a raincoat.
A rain shower?
It's so cold...
You see it too, right? The sky turned dark all of a sudden!
Everyone's here for the Hunting Contest.
Are you going to join the Hunting Contest, too?
Don't overdo it while you're hunting, and take it easy when you need to. That's the sort of hunter that lasts the longest.
Damn it, why is it raining? I hate rain.
You can see the beasts better in the snow. It's a great opportunity for hunters.
Look at the sky!
That's an awesome weapon! You won't need to worry.
Can you share any secrets for hunting wolves?
Are you going to join the Hunting Contest, too? That means I don't stand a chance...
That Amitoi looks pretty special.
If you hunt together with your guild members, you won't have to fear even the strongest beasts!
Watch out for the goblins. They're fast.
Let's go hunting again today!
There are dangerous places all around here. Be careful when you're going out at night.
Darn. I should have brought a raincoat. 
I knew this would happen. That's why I dressed warm today.
Look at how dark it got!
Can I take a look at your weapon? Where did you get it?
^<c=@MK_D_Dialogue>{gva_PcName}^</c>? Are you really THE ^<c=@MK_D_Dialogue>{gva_PcName}^</c>?
You're in a guild? I'm so jealous.
Can I help you? Just let me know.
Let me know if you need dinner or anything else.
What would you like to order? Something to warm you up from the snow?
It's raining again? I should clean the floor.
I can do business safely now that Laslan is free. I just hope this peace lasts.
Time flies. I should hurry up and prepare dinner.
When it's snowing, it's best to stay inside and warm up.
If your clothes are wet, you can dry them off in front of the fire. There's no charge for that!
There's always more to research.
Mana may be invisible, but it's always around us.
True magic is from Venelux. Civilian magic pales in comparison.
Humans have a short memory, but history is recorded in the flow of mana.
I've got a headache after focusing all day long.
It's snowing? How annoying.
This rain... What sort of magic is this?
This isn't typical magic. Could it be related to the elemental spirits?
When I was young, I used to think life would be amazing if I became a wizard.
Have you heard of Harvesters? They're fascinating dolls that help wizards with their research.
Night has fallen. I should light up some candles.
It's raining? What's going on?
Oh, it's snowing.
I came from Venelux to investigate the Wasteland and strengthen the barrier.
The monsters here are dangerous. Don't let your guard down.
The day is already over.
The air feels fresh since it's raining.
I really miss Venelux today.
There's magic inside that little doll accompanying you.
I'm not sure if this experiment is a success or failure...
You just watch. I'm going to research magic that will make history one day.
Huh? When did the sun set?
The sky is red? This magic must be...
It's raining again! My cloak's going to get all wet.
I hope the snow doesn't pile up...
Humans contaminated the earth with war, so it's our responsibility to purify it.
Did you see the dead land of the Ruins of Turayne? It's the sorrowful vestiges left behind by war.
It only takes an instant to destroy something, while it takes hundreds of years to rebuild.
I'm doing my best to teach the trainees, but they're falling way behind in comparison to Venelux.
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit busy with my research.
Why are the young wizard trainees so lazy these days?! 
I miss Venelux today...
Do you have any questions about magic?
It's pretty late. Do you have business in the tower?
The trees of the forest become stronger when it's raining. Be careful.
Hello, ^<c=@MK_D_Dialogue>{gva_PcName}^</c>. What brings you to the Purelight Tower?
Why are you here? The Purelight Tower isn't for people like you.
What are you lookin' at?
After work, you have to wind down with a drink!
What? You got somethin' to say?
I'm all done with work, so I should head home.
Quit loitering and go your way.
I can protect you at night if you have the money, but there's no need for that... 
It's not good to be nosy.
You should think before you strike up a conversation with just anyone. I hate getting interrupted.
You won't see prices like this anywhere else! Take a look at what we have!
You're not going to die, just to get your hands on some Sollant, right? Nothing is worth more than your life!
Ahem... I'm losing my voice.
Oh, I should start heading home.
It's raining pretty hard today. 
All my goods will be ruined because of the rain!
As if business wasn't already slow... Now it's snowing?
Check if you're missing anything before you take off. Laslan is bigger than you think.
The more consumables, the better. Don't you think so?
Goodness, would you look at the time?
Oh, no! My goods will get wet!
Do you think the road will get blocked off if it snows?
I... I can't see the sun!
Care to browse through some specialties? I have lots of high-quality items.
Where are you from?
I'm so tired.
Oh, my! Look at the snow!
What? The sun is gone? This must be the work of a demon!
Take a look at my wares! Or don't...
I have lots of great items at affordable prices!
We're able to do business here in this dangerous place, thanks to the Resistance Guard.
Get away! I hate how bugs are attracted to the light.
Now I'll have less customers since it's raining. What to do...?
I can't believe I have to do business in this weather. Oh, dear!
Do you see that? The sky got dark!
You think that weapon could pierce the thick leather of the orcs? 
Don't you have any other armor? Don't tell me you're going to keep wearing that.
The Flame Watcher? That's a great title!
I-I have nothing more to sell. Please let me go.
^<c=@MK_D_Dialogue>{gva_PcName}^</c>? I can't believe you're here!
I can tell you're a rookie, even from far away. You should train some more and come back when you're ready.
Lots of adventurers have passed by, but I've never seen an Amitoi that's better than yours.
Check if you have all the consumables you need before entering a dungeon.
I was almost ambushed by goblins on my way here today. The Resistance saved me.
Ugh. It's so dark. I should go home.
It rains too often around here.
Don't the goblins ever get cold?
D-did the sun just disappear?
That weapon of yours looks great on you.
Starlight Collector? If you like stars, you should hang around the Observatory!
You don't have to buy anything. Please, just go...
^<c=@MK_D_Dialogue>{gva_PcName}^</c>? What's a celebrity doing here at the Observatory?
What's the name of that cute doll that's following you around?
Take a look at the village specialties! We have lots of high-quality leather.
The village is so busy these days. It's great for business.
Kastleton is the best place to live!
I should close up shop...
The rain is going to ruin business for the day!
A warm drink at the inn is perfect on a cold day like this!
Is the sky crumbling down?
Don't you need a stronger weapon? You should go speak to the Equipment Merchant.
The Equipment Merchant is an honest fellow. Go visit if you ever need new clothes.
I heard the Golden Rye Pastures are safe now. It's all thanks to you.
Lobsters were a common thing to eat before the ocean got polluted. Now only peculiar people like you are after them.
^<c=@MK_D_Dialogue>{gva_PcName}^</c>...? What are you doing here?
Your Contract Coin Pouch looks pretty heavy! Don't you know Coins are meant to be used, not collected?
Where did you get that fascinating Amitoi?
You've got to buy some of our village specialty wine! You won't find prices like this anywhere else.
I'll give you a special discount. Come in! Come in!
Oh, would you look at the time?
Did you know? When it rains too much, wine loses its flavor.
Winter in the desert is harsh. You should prepare yourself.
I'm sure the gods are angry at us! You should pray, too!
I can't believe you crossed the desert in those tattered clothes! There's a talented Armor Crafter in Vienta, you know.
If you want to travel through Stonegard, you'll need better weapons. Why don't you get yourself some new equipment?
That's a rare Amitoi that money just can't buy. Where did you get it?
You came back alive from the Sandworm Lair? You're a monster!
If you don't get hot easily, it must be easy for you to travel through the desert.
Oh! A special customer! What brings you to Vienta, ^<c=@MK_D_Dialogue>{gva_PcName}^</c>?
A special customer from the {gva_PcGuildName} guild! Take all the time you need.
It doesn't matter how well my business does. After paying taxes, I can barely feed myself.
You should go to the retail shop if you want to buy items. We only take bulk orders here.
If you need food, there's a merchant who makes them.
Let's go home now.
Oh, no! This isn't supposed to get wet!
The snow is inconvenient for us, but the children love it.
Wasn't it daytime just now? Is this a dream?
You look like an adventurer. Don't you need a better weapon?
Why don't you buy new armor while you're in the castle? The desert monsters are terrifying, you know.
Your Amitoi looks exhausted. I don't think it's faring well in the desert.
Oh, ^<c=@MK_D_Dialogue>{gva_PcName}^</c>! Do you need anything?
Did you come all the way here to the castle to cause trouble again?
If you're not in a guild, you can't deal with the Guild Merchant. You know that, right? 
Please tell the lord to have mercy on the merchants.
Even if I do business all day, I have nothing left after taxes! The lord around here has no mercy...
This is the center of all trade in Stonegard! There's nothing you can't find here.
Look at the time! I should take a break.
I can't believe it's raining.
I'm sure the snow will melt before you know it. Don't worry.
Look at the sky! What could be happening?
Don't you need a better weapon? That weapon won't get you too far.
The more Amitoi you have, the better. How many do you have?
I made eye contact with ^<c=@MK_D_Dialogue>{gva_PcName}^</c>! Today must be my lucky day!
Wh-what? I'm going to call the guard!
If you're friends with the Pirate King, you're no ordinary customer.
You killed that many demons? I can't believe you defeated those terrifying creatures. You must be quite talented.
Aren't you from the {gva_PcGuildName} guild? Oh, you're a very special customer!
The lord is gracious! Now all the merchants can rest easy.
This area used to prosper because of all the lumber exports.
It gets cold very quickly at night, so the merchants go home since there are no customers anyway.
I should call it a day.
Everything is going to get wet! No!
I just can't believe it's snowing!
Did I doze off? How did the sun set already?
Have you visited the Equipment Merchant? Your armor will be torn up by the lycans' claws in an instant.
I used to sell weapons for a while, but I've never seen one like yours before.
There are strong Amitoi and weak Amitoi. Didn't you know that?
Of course, I recognize you, ^<c=@MK_D_Dialogue>{gva_PcName}^</c>. Is there anything you need in Canina Village?
Based on your title, I can tell you've defeated quite a few of those conniving lycans!
Why do the guards allow a murderer to roam free in the village? Think about the children, at least!
Is that an Amitoi? It looks much stronger than the other Amitoi I've seen.
These days, I hardly get to see items that are luxurious enough to satisfy me.
Do you have a problem?
Dinner better be prepared exactly as I instructed.
Snow? I should have ridden the carriage.
I wouldn't have come out if I knew it would rain.
What happened to the sun?
Why is it raining all of a sudden?
Improving the lives of commoners can help the village to prosper. I always keep that in mind.
Would you like to hear the history of our family?
Late salon gatherings are difficult to attend.
I should have them take care of the roof so that the snow doesn't pile up.
I should have brought an umbrella...
The climate of Stonegard is dry. It's a scorching desert, after all.
I'm always rooting for the Resistance.
It's finally cooling down a bit. 
I hope the rain cools off the heat.
I need to take a break in the shade.
Kastleton has become much livelier, but many people are still anxious.
I usually send someone else for errands at the port to avoid its fishy smell.
The village economy has become more prosperous thanks to the Resistance.
I'm done for today. I'll head home now.
The weather calls for clothing with fine fur.
Oh, no... It'll get humid in the library.
It suddenly got dark... I'm sure this is the work of the gods.
What? You killed a fellow member of the Resistance?
I heard the Blackhowl Plains are a dangerous place. You must be very strong.
Lobster Maniac? You have peculiar taste, don't you?
I heard there are many benefits of joining a guild.
Which guild did you join? I'm so curious.
Oh! I've never seen that Amitoi before.
^<c=@MK_D_Dialogue>{gva_PcName}^</c>? I wasn't expecting to meet someone famous today!
I like your weapon.
If you need anything, go visit the workshop or market.
Ugh... My skin hasn't been in good condition lately.
Public order is still much better compared to before.
I knew it. The sky had me worried.
I'm sure this rain will pass soon.
People like you should be locked up in the underground prison with the monsters.
Where did you find such a fine Amitoi? My child would love to have one like that.
It's an honor to be acquainted with someone famous as you.
Judging from your clothes, you must be the modest sort.
I'm always grateful to {gva_PcGuildName}.
The castle is so lively these days, all thanks to the gracious lord.
Even though we're surrounded by the desert, our village has no shortage of water. We owe the wizards for that.
The wine of Vienta is pretty good.
I should tell them to keep the light on for the children.
I hope the sand dust settles soon.
Criminals should be arrested on the spot.
I heard there are lots of interesting monsters in the Moonlight Desert. Is that true?
If you're not a member of a guild, don't you miss out on a lot of stuff?
What's the name of your cute Amitoi?
Everyone in Vienta Village respects you, ^<c=@MK_D_Dialogue>{gva_PcName}^</c>.
You must be part of the {gva_PcGuildName} guild that defends Stonegard Castle. Please take good care of Vienta Village.
How do they expect us to pay these taxes? I'll have to sell everything I have...
With so many adventurers coming here these days, my potions have been selling like hot cakes.
I like how I get to travel to various villages, thanks to the nature of my job.
The stars must be aligned when you're in the business of buying and selling. You can't just put something out and expect to turn a profit.
I'd better organize the ledger in bed.
It's snowing again? I hope the carriage doesn't slip on the road.
A diligent merchant doesn't rest even in heavy rain.
I used to think Laslan was done for... But it turns out there's no other place like it.
The life of a peddler is a lonely one.
The night air feels so refreshing.
Oh, I might have to expect lots of traffic.
Darn. All my stuff is going to get wet.
You might wonder what we could possibly sell in the desert. But it's actually chock-full of endless possibilities for us merchants.
The sand is such a nuisance. Ugh, it's coarse and rough and irritating.
Maybe I should go rest now.
I can't hold business because of the snow.
I'm glad it's raining. It'll cool down the scorching weather.
War is the absolute worst. But what can we do about it?
(Sigh)
My back hurts...
And another day is over...
Snow? I definitely can't go out tonight.
Even the weather is against me...
The sky is red? The gods must be angry!
Should I feel lucky to not have starved to death yet?
Well, we're still alive, thanks to the Resistance.
I'm grateful to the Resistance's adventurers.
I should go home...
It's getting colder and colder...
When is the rain going to stop?
Oh, my... What happened to the sky?
Whatever... I'm just trudging along, day by day... 
Everything was great before the war. The Arkeum Legion is to blame for everything that's gone wrong...
I hope things get better before I die.
I hope we all survive through the night...
What's going on?
At least we can drink some water.
Huh? What's going on here?
Do you make a lot of money if you're in the Resistance?
What's the point of there being lots of shops in the market? People like us can't afford anything.
I'll curse the names of those who started the war until the day I die.
It'll be terrible if it gets any colder.
My child's clothes will get wet again. They have nothing else to wear...
The sun has set already.
Be careful out there. There are a million things you can trip over near the ship.
Hey! Have a good day!
Let's call it a day. Now it's time to drink!
Why is it snowing all of a sudden? I should just go home.
I should cover everything up with tarp and take a break.
L-look over there! That's definitely a bad sign!
Seems like there are more travelers here now, huh? That's good news.
If you're from an island, did you come here on a ship?
Ships require constant maintenance to keep afloat.
Did you hear DaVinci invented navigation technology using magic? I hear that ships can travel to different continents in a jiffy now!
We take good care of our cargo, but we always seem to miss something when we have big shipments. 
Aren't you curious about what lies beyond the ocean?
The sun sets so fast these days. I can barely get any work done.
Snow? Again? But I just cleared it away!
I should clean the deck while it's raining.
The gods are definitely angry at us!
Huh? Do you have business with me?
Welcome to Kastleton Port!
Hey! Move your lazy butts!
Just ask me if you have any questions!
The weather is so unpredictable.
It's raining again! I'm sick and tired of this.
You should pray until the sun comes back!
What's the most famous thing here?
I'm so tired. I should go back.
It snows around here?
You should stay out of the rain.
Rain? All of a sudden?
Oh, my... It looks like everything is covered in blood!
I can't believe that I'm really here in Laslan. I thought it was completely reduced to ash.
I didn't even do anything and it's already nighttime.
I heard Laslan is famous for the snow...
Darn! I'm all wet!
The weather is awful... I wouldn't be here if it weren't for the wine.
Touring might be better when it's cooler at night.
How is it snowing in the desert?
Phew. It's better now that it's raining.
Aren't all fellow travelers friends? It's nice to meet you.
I like how quiet this village is at night.
Snow... It's so romantic.
I hope the air smells nice and fresh after the rain.
Ugh, a murderer...
I heard the Akidu orcs are very strong. You must be quite skilled.
So, you're the Reaper that all werewolves fear.
We free spirits are just fine without a guild.
It must be nice to have such a strong Amitoi with you.
Everyone in my hometown has heard about you, ^<c=@MK_D_Dialogue>{gva_PcName}^</c>.
Are you on a long journey? Your clothes look worn out.
Some Resistance soldiers were running toward Grayclaw Forest just now. Is something happening?
Sorry, but I'm working right now. Please talk to someone else if you need help.
There's no end to all this work...
It's already this late? I still have much to do...
Snow or not, the work's gotta be done.
It's raining? How annoying.
Has the sun really set?
It's good to be busy, but only if you're getting paid.
I'm glad I had a hearty meal before coming.
Maybe I'll get a glass of mead after work.
It's easy to get hurt while working out in the cold, so you should always be careful.
They should let us wear raincoats while working! Look at how messy I've gotten.
Is it nighttime? That means I can go home!
If you don't take breaks from time to time, you could faint from heatstroke.
I feel dizzy after working in the sun all day.
I'm busy. We can talk later.
It's time to calculate the daily wages.
It's going to get cold pretty soon.
Darn! My clothes are going to get wet!
Did I doze off? I swear it was daytime just a minute ago!
Vienta Port is the largest port in Stonegard.
When you work at the port, your skin gets all salty.
The wine produced in Vienta is popular overseas, too!
I haven't seen you before. Where are you from?
Huh? It smells fishy? Well, obviously! We're at a port!
Stand back if you're not going to help.
Agh. My back hurts.
Achoo! I keep sneezing...
Darn this rain! We're going to be delayed again.
Hello there.
What? Do you need something?
I should get going now.
No wonder. My back has been aching.
No wonder. My joints have been aching.
What's going on? Why is it dark all of a sudden?
A sudden solar eclipse? This can't be a good sign.
Why is it raining all of a sudden...?!
Life isn't all that bad these days. It's all thanks to the Resistance.
Time sure flies. I can't believe how long it's been since the Arkeum Legion's invasion...
I wonder if the kids got home safely...
It'll be hard to walk around once the snow piles up...
When it rains, my whole body aches...
You get to see all sorts of things if you live long enough. Like a forest turning into a desert. Or watching one lord replace another...
It must be good to be young. They have so much energy, even in this heat.
Sometimes, I just want to sit outside and do nothing.
Never thought I'd live to see this...
I'm grateful for the rain...
The shade is the best on a hot day.
I'm just grateful for everything these days. Thanks to DaVinci and the Resistance, I have things to be grateful for.
Is it your first time here? I dare you to find a better place to live!
I'll watch the sunset before going home.
I'm going to sweep up the snow in front of my house.
Did I close the window at home?
Ahh! I don't have anything! I swear!
The Conqueror of Wolves? You did something wonderful for us all. Thank you.
You shouldn't go around telling secrets. You'll understand when you're older.
You're famous, aren't you? How are you faring these days?
Guild members help each other out, right? Good for you.
This is just a farm. It's nothing special. I just hope for a good harvest in the fall.
The sun has to be hot for the grain to ripen properly.
You're the one who protected the rye fields? Oh, thank you so much.
The night brings out all the mosquitos and bugs.
I should sweep up the snow.
Close the windows, kids.
Did you come to buy our village's wine? I feel like there are more travelers visiting these days.
Every day is so hot nowadays.
Oh, my knees. It's too steep.
Snow? I never thought I'd live to see this.
I hope to collect a lot of rainwater.
Oh! I don't have a penny on me!
Wow, you're amazing. You're in the Resistance's top three?
I hear that joining a guild is all the rage these days.
You're in the guild that owns the castle, right? Please take good care of our village.
The taxes these days... Tsk tsk... Huh? Oh, it's nothing.
You can't ignore the heat just because you're young. You'll be sorry if you do!
Everyone here is a merchant. That's why the living conditions are much better here than in other villages.
I heard that this oasis was created by a certain archwizard.
I should go home now.
I can't believe this is happening.
I should clean up everything outside the tent.
Oh, I don't know anything!
You're up there in the ranks? You must be quite talented.
You should always be a member of a guild. Then, you get to help your fellow members and be helped by them in return.
The Pirate King is just a legend. I don't know why the young people are so crazy about it.
Some of the youngsters think the Werewolf is just an old legend. Little do they know it's lurking around in that forest.
Wait... Did you hear that wolf's howl? If you didn't, then never mind...
I should go back before it gets dark.
I wonder if it'll pile up.
The trees are going to grow up nice and tall.
Agh! I don't have any money!
A ranker? You must be very strong...
I heard you taught those lycans a lesson! Thanks a lot. We're safe because of you.
I love talking to young people.
My shoulders are a little stiff today...
In my time, I was pretty strong myself.
The snow reminds me of my childhood...
When it rains, my knees hurt and it's hard to get around.
When the sky is like this, weird things happen.
Be careful not to get caught in the storm.
That's one hell of a weapon. My husband had a weapon shop when he was young.
There's a lot of talk about you in the village. You're so young and so skilled.
There's a lot of talk about you in the village. You're so impressive.
I wish I could get my granddaughter an Amitoi...
The Swamp of Silence is home to a monster even more dangerous than the ferocious sharks.
Looking for the best techs in Talandre? Everyone's great. Just ask.
You know the saying, imitation is the mother of creation, right? That's how a lot of technology came to be.
Many technicians are taking on the challenge of developing ways to light up the darkness.
I wonder if it's snowing where my son is.
I'm building a device to predict how much rain will fall.
At some point in your life, a solar eclipse shouldn't surprise you.
If only there was a technology that could predict heavy rain...
Can you show me your equipment? It doesn't look like ordinary equipment to me.
I've heard my son talk about you. He said you were amazing.
I'm not interested in fighting, but I've heard your name before.
Amitoi never cease to amaze me.
You have to be able to read the weather to farm properly.
I don't have much to do at my age. Working in the fields is my only pastime.
Farmers still have a lot of work to do at night.
I need to cover everything from getting snowed on.
All of my joints are aching.
When the cursed rain fell ten years ago, I thought we were all done for.
Since the Resistance is working to protect us, I can enjoy farming in peace.
Yikes. I should go home now.
I wish it would rain.
Oh, dear. I hope the fields don't freeze.
The rain is nice and moist.
All the rye will fall down because of the rainstorm!
Good wine comes from good grapes.
The grapes from our village are the best in the world.
The sun has to come out for the grapes to ripen.
Now that the weather is cooler, I should go to bed.
At this rate, I won't be able to pay all the taxes, even if the harvest turns out great.
You should try the apricots before you leave the village.
The harvest continues, and we live without worry.
I'd better get home, so I can work again tomorrow.
The right amount of snow helps with farming.
Rain is calming to me.
What's wrong with the sky...? It won't hurt the crops, will it?
I was hoping for some rain, but not this much.
Nice equipment! I can see it even with my bad eyes!
Oh, you've defeated a lot of monsters. Thank you!
Welcome. This place is famous for its apricot jam. You must try it!
My grandson walks around like that Amitoi of yours.
It's a good day for fishing.
What fish will I catch today?
Can I see anything in the dark? Hoho, fishing isn't done with your eyes.
Uh-oh, it's snowing. I'm just going to catch one and go home.
The bite is slow on a rainy day. Even the fish have sore joints.
Oh no, the sky is dark. Even the fish must think it's bedtime.
Who's making it rain like this?
That's a great piece of equipment! I have the same thing... No? My eyes are blurry.
You're famous, aren't you? I'd love to catch you a fresh fish.
You're the famous adventurer. Enjoy fishing and relaxing.
That's an Amitoi, isn't it? I'd love to have one next to me when I'm fishing!
Mm... Do I know you?
So, are you hurt anywhere?
It's harder to see now that it's night...
Be careful not to fall in the snow. You could be seriously injured.
Rain is a blessing to the earth.
Mm? Are we in a solar eclipse right now?
There is a price to pay for changing the weather.
You must be very strong to be carrying all that heavy equipment. Good for you!
Did I finish all my work for today?
The Purelight Tower was built to purify this land of all darkness.
I sense powerful magic! Someone caused this solar eclipse.
Someone is making the rain fall. I can feel the magic flowing.
Hm... Is this artificial rain? Well, as long as it's not cursed...
Many of the wizards here came from Venelux.
The power of darkness is more dangerous because it can spread to other beings.
Young Leon has great potential. He knows how to follow the natural order.
Elter from Venelux and Leon, who was born here, have an unspoken rivalry.
If you're curious, you can come take a proper look. I won't charge you or anything.
The profits just aren't very much these days...
Tomorrow is another day. 
No! All my goods will go bad!
Why is it raining all of a sudden? Is a storm brewing?
Check this out. There are lots of great items other than wine!
I have lots of rare items from a famous merchant group. You'll be sorry if you miss this opportunity!
I should close up shop now.
You'll be eaten alive with that sort of equipment! You need something much better.
Are you the one everybody wants as their comrade? You're popular, aren't you?
A fine Amitoi will pick up dropped items, I hear. Is that true?
Hahaha! Life is good these days. The lord is so kind to us all.
I think the taxes are too high... There! I said it!
Um... Could you maybe ask the lord to lower the tax rate?
The items in my shop reflect my experience and taste!
I only sell stuff I'd give to my grandkids.
I'm closing for the day soon. You should look while you can.
What's with all the snow? I hope my products don't freeze.
My back is aching, and it's raining. Should I just sell them cheap and go home?
The sky is acting up again. Don't worry. It happens sometimes.
I don't mind the rain, but I can't stand the wind!
Wow, your equipment is really shiny!
You're the one who goes around defeating all the monsters. Thank you.
You're one of the top two members of the Resistance, aren't you? Feel free to look around.
Did you know that every Amitoi has a different personality?
Just take it one step at a time. Better safe than sorry.
I managed to live this old by a combination of luck and skill.
The moon and stars are bright tonight.
I bet my grandchildren would love this. 
Mm, it rained back then, too...
Does our village look peaceful to you? It hasn't been long since it changed for the better.
I should take a walk...
Were the lights on in my house?
I wish it would snow, even though it gets cold.
Oh, dear. It's raining all of a sudden.
I hope my older child doesn't get caught in the rain.
This is the safest place in the desert.
The merchants are in control these days.
The desert is the best place to go stargazing.
I hope the rain moistens the entire desert.
Hm... This is no ordinary rain.
There's nothing more precious than water in the desert.
Are you an adventurer? The people here might be a bit gruff, but they're all kind.
We helped fight alongside the Resistance ten years ago. We didn't just stand by and watch.
I hope my husband got home safely...
I hope my older child is okay.
My youngest child used to love the rain...
Don't walk around the village with your eyes so wide open! You look scary.
You should get yourself some better equipment.
Yikes, your Amitoi is extremely cute!
Since you're in a guild, you must be in the Resistance. Please do your best with the contracts.
The tax rate is pretty high in Stonegard nowadays. Our village is doing fine, thanks to Lord Hobs.
Traveler, take a nice break before you go. This village is the best place in the area to rest up.
I heard the wine from our village is famous all the way up north. Haha!
I hope the weather cools down now.
I don't care if it rains. I need to go pray for my children.
Oh, you scared me! What is it? Please don't take anything from me.
You're going on adventures with that equipment? Oh, dear... You're gambling with your life, you know.
How much does an Amitoi cost? Do you think I can get one for my children?
Are you in the {gva_PcGuildName} guild? Please, take good care of our village.
These taxes are breaking my back.
I'm just barely surviving. That's the best I can do...
There's not a single part of my body that doesn't hurt.
And so another day goes by...
Even the heavens have turned a blind eye to us...
I'll have to endure all this rain...
It doesn't matter how old you are. Scary things are still scary.
Oh, my knees...
How will I survive another night...?
Ugh, the aches...
This is why my whole body aches...
I can't even feed myself. How am I supposed to pay these taxes?
They don't care if we die. So what can we possibly do about it?
If this is how I go, then that's that...
The sunset is beautiful.
The rain doesn't make anything better...
Is it time to go...?
Another day has gone by...
I wish I'd become healthy and feel as nice and relaxed as pure, fallen snow...
My whole body aches...
Why be so stubborn about staying alive...?
I might be older, but I'm still useful!
The work just never ends!
Phew. I should hurry up and go home to rest.
It's hard to work when your hands are frozen.
Why is it raining all of a sudden?!
Believe it or not, nearly half of Laslan was built by my hands.
Oh, my back... I know I should straighten it every now and then, but I forget.
You're going to get a cold at this rate. You should avoid the rain when you're working.
Don't overwork yourself in this heat. Take a rest in the shade every once in a while.
The sandstorm always gives us more repair work to do. 
Do you need my assistance?
Do you need something from me?
Oh! Is it time for dinner already? I better get home soon.
The snow is falling so beautifully...
(Sigh) My clothes are all wet.
Huh? The sky looks so strange all of a sudden.
What's going on? Why is the sky red all of a sudden?
Oh, my! What's with this rain?
If I think about everything that happened long ago, this place isn't such a bad place to live anymore.
I'm seeing a lot of travelers today.
Oh, it already got dark.
I have to clear up the snow again...
Oh, no! I have to take down the laundry!
Even your sweat will dry up over here.
Make sure you always have water while you're here.
The sun seems to set faster when you're busy.
It's nice and cool now that it's raining.
It's so hot today. I wish someone would use magic to make it rain!
Did you have a question for me? 
I've never seen you around. Are you visiting?
I should go home before it gets too dark.
I hope the paths don't freeze...
It smells like sewage every time it rains.
Oh! You've got the wrong person.
Whoa! That's a nice weapon you have. I used to work at an equipment shop, so I know a good weapon when I see one.
You must be that famous Lobster Maniac! It's great to meet you!
I heard guild members are like brothers. Is it true? I want to hear all about it!
I hear you're very talented. Word about you has already spread all over the place!
Isn't that an Amitoi? Wow! I've never seen one in person before!
Sure, there are lots of pests to deal with, but this is still the largest granary in all of Laslan.
Are you looking for something?
The day goes by so fast sometimes...
I wish it would stop snowing.
There's an earthy scent because of all this rain.
Wine is a specialty of this region. It's even famous outside of the continent.
All travelers who pass through the desert stop by this area at least once.
It's time for the stores to close for the day. I should go before it gets too late.
What's going on? It's snowing?
The rain tends to clear up the air.
Where are the guards?
That's a nice weapon. Where did you get it?
You're that person from Stonemason Town, right? I heard they couldn't have done it without you.
How are you liking the guild activities? It sounds like a lot of work if you ask me.
I have so much respect for people like you who are recognized as the best in their field.
Are all Amitoi that adorable?
I'm seeing a lot of people from the {gva_PcGuildName} guild.
What's the point of making money? I'll have nothing left after paying taxes, anyway.
We have more water here than anywhere else in Stonegard.
If you ever need help, please just let me know.
My family is waiting for me. I should hurry up and go.
It's snowing here, too?
I wish it would rain more often.
You must have a lot of experience under your belt. I can tell because you're so good at everything.
You're going to the Wasteland, right? Other adventurers have gone there too to stop the rampaging monsters.
You have to be careful outside of town. There are orcs to the east and lycans to the west.
The lycans in this region are more ferocious than anywhere else. They will attack absolutely anyone, so you can't be too careful.
I should go home.
It's snowing...
Wow! It's raining! I hope it rains a lot!
Phew... What kind of life was lived behind those scary eyes...?
I bet a weapon that good is hard to find. I wish I had one for self-defense.
So you're the one who doesn't let size intimidate them! I heard you were incredible in Akidu Valley. You're amazing!
I think it would be comforting to travel with guild members.
It's not easy to become a recognized figure like you.
I really want an Amitoi too!
Why are people from the {gva_PcGuildName} guild here?
I get a headache whenever I think about taxes.
There are more merchants and people these days, so everything feels more active and lively.
The people here owe a lot to the Resistance.
It would be good to light a fire and hold a festival in the plaza at night...
When it rains, it reminds me of a song someone used to sing.
With so many people coming and going, the dust builds up quickly, even after cleaning.
This is pretty clean for an inn in the countryside.
I didn't really do anything, but the sun has already set.
Ugh, so much rain all of a sudden! The ground is a mess with all that muddy water.
Lord Hobs is highly reputed even among the others in the Resistance.
Thanks to the lord, our lives begin to improve.
I need to stay at the lord's residence until the rain stops.
Oh, look at the time! Let's have a drink before going home.
Should I buy this or that...? Ahh, it's a tough choice.
It's lucky that supplies have been plentiful lately.
Oh, my, I need to go back to get the laundry!
Oh, I don't want to prepare dinner... I wish someone would do it for me.
I feel no joy from anything since my husband died.
I'm so sad that I can't be with him anymore...
When it rains, I miss my husband's warmth even more...
At night, my memories with him become more vivid, and all I can feel is heartache...
It would be best to buy things right when you need them.
Ah, where was it? I saw something I liked before...
Even if rain falls, the prices of things don't.
Are there any special discounts only at night?
When the wind blows, I feel my gloomy mood flying away, too.
If the weather is good tomorrow, I will go on a picnic with my friends.
I think I become full of imagination at night!
Stepping on the pure white snow somehow makes me feel good.
I like the earthy smell when it rains.
Oh my, that's strange. A solar eclipse...
Suddenly raining... It's like someone used a magic.
Your equipment is really cool! I really admire it!
Are you by any chance the adventurer in the rumors...? No, nothing!
Could you be the adventurer in the rumors...? No, nevermind!
Amitoi is so lovely. I think you would have a good time together.
They say that monsters as small as children live in the Swamp of Silence. What does it look like?
If we techs want something, we have to build it, or we'd lose our minds!
Highly developed technology is an art in itself.
Technicians are the people who light the way in the dark.
Someday, there will be technology to keep the snow from piling up on the ground.
I've been working on a rain-powered dynamo for a while now. Sounds interesting, doesn't it?
The moon and the sun... Oh, what did you say? I was just thinking about something.
It's raining really hard. I should think of a device for times like this.
Your equipment is not ordinary by any stretch of the imagination.
My friend is one of your admirers. He'll be so jealous when he finds out I've met you.
I-it's an honor to meet s-someone as famous as you!
There was something I wanted to ask an Amitoi when I saw one... but I can't think of it!
Once you experience the joy of harvesting, you can't bring yourself to do anything else.
I raised these crops like they were my own children!
Oh, the sun has already set!
All my crops are going to freeze!
I'm glad it's raining!
If it weren't for pests, I would have a much higher yield. But they simply won't go away.
After breakfast, it's suddenly lunchtime. Then, after I eat lunch, it's already dinnertime. Even so, I can't go without having a snack, either.
The sun is setting already? My, how the time flies. 
Ugh. I have to sweep the roof again?
The rain will help the crops grow.
It's raining so hard, all the grain will fall out at this rate!
I have to prune the grapevines and weed out the little ones... There's so much to do.
The grapes we harvested last year were top tier. I have a good feeling about this year.
Today felt pretty rewarding, after all's said and done.
Nothing more honest than farming.
I wish we had a good harvest this year like last year...
I work so hard these days, I even dream about farming...
Snow keeps the roots of crops from freezing in cold weather.
Ah... it's rain! It'll be good for drying crops.
The reason for a solar eclipse? I don't know anything other than farming.
I'm worried about no rain, but also worried about this much rain.
I only know about farming equipment, but your equipment looks amazing.
You're the adventurer in the rumors! Thanks to you, I can do farming peacefully.
You're the adventurer in the rumors. Be sure to try our local apricots!
Your Amitoi looks like a good companion!
Fishing can be seen as an art of patience, waiting for the best moment.
I feel the best when I catch fish!
When I cast my fishing rod in the middle of the night, I feel I can catch the moonlight.
There is no bite today. The fish must have hid deep in the water because it is cold.
Can you hear the sound of rain even under water? Probably not, right?
Whoa, look at the sky! I think we're going to catch a special fish today!
This is weird. It didn't look like it was going to rain. I think we should pass on fishing today.
Your equipment looks really nice! I'd have to sell a hundred fish to buy that.
Aren't you the famous adventurer? Oh my, it's an honor to meet you!
Aren't you the famous... Oh my, I never thought I'd meet you!
Oh, your Amitoi is so cute! Can it eat fish? Would you like one?
Nothing to report!
My shift will end soon.
Hurry up and go home. It's dark out.
Go to a safe place and out of the rain.
I'm on guard duty right now.
We're going to keep this area safe.
It's best not to roam without good reason at night. It's dangerous.
I'm making sure everyone is safe.
If you see anyone acting suspicious, please let me know.
Try not to walk around at night.
I'm on watch duty right now.
I'm watching the orcs and their movements.
Nobody knows when the orcs will attack, so you shouldn't walk around at night.
I want to gain experience and do something amazing like you.
The orcs are having another Festival of Fire? We have to stop them. Is there anyone who can help?
I'm patrolling the ruins.
If you find any civilians who are trapped because of the undead, please let me know.
The undead become even more aggressive at night. Be careful.
Wolves are nocturnal. You must be careful at night.
How much experience do I need to become as strong as you?
Everyone is off at the Wolf Hunting Contest.
I'm in the middle of a mission. I don't have time for chatter.
This is Kastleton, the foundation of the Resistance.
It's dangerous at night. It's best not to roam around too late.
I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to inspect you.
Hey, that weapon looks nice.
Are you the Wolf Slayer? The plains are much safer, thanks to you.
If you're in the Resistance, you must join a guild. Try joining one.
I can't believe I met someone as famous as you! It's an honor, really.
Are those tiny Amitoi really helpful? Then, I should buy one for myself, too.
We received a report, so I'm patrolling the area.
Don't overwork yourself. You should go somewhere safe.
Oh, dear... When did you get so much experience?
Oh, I guess I'm not the only one here. Everyone else went to the Starlight Stones Ritual.
I'm currently on guard duty. Please ask someone else for a tour of the village.
This is Vienta, a proud village of Stonegard.
Please stay inside at night.
I would like to ask for your cooperation.
Wow! I can't believe you have that weapon! How did you get it?
Are you the Sandworm Stalker? I've heard all about you!
This place is too dangerous to travel alone. You should join a guild and go together with your members.
I hope I can be as strong as you one of these days.
I wonder what it's like to have an Amitoi. Do they help you on your missions?
What brings a member of the defending guild here?
Lots of people are unhappy because of taxes these days.
The castle is safe.
What's going on? I'm on duty, so please don't bother me.
Please don't cause any trouble.
That's the best weapon I've seen in a while. Where did you get it?
You can't do much without joining a guild. Join one if you're part of the Resistance.
I aspire to become a hero like you one day.
Do you think Amitoi can help defend the castle, too?
You must be part of the defending guild. Welcome.
People are unhappy these days because of the taxes.
This village is safe in our hands.
Don't let your guard down while you're outside.
Please go back indoors before it gets too dark.
Accidents are unacceptable. Please stay safe.
Can I take a look at your weapon? I've been thinking about getting a new one.
Are you the Full Moon Reaper? You've been very helpful to us.
I heard only the bravest warriors join guilds. Is that true?
I only just recognized you. It's an honor to meet you in person.
Don't you think Amitoi could help protect the village? I should suggest this to officers above.
What brings a member of the defending guild all the way here?
I hear lots of people complaining over the taxes.
Currently, there is no specific problem.
I'm on guard right now.
You'd better take a rest at your accommodation at night.
Thinking about cleaning this up, it feels like garbage falling from the sky, not snow.
Whew, I'll have to clean all the armor again.
Who used magic again? The sky is terrifying.
If it rains suddenly, there's a strong chance that it's magic.
The place around here is a bit dangerous, so you'd better have good equipment.
You are the master of monster hunting. Please take good care of the Resistance Contract.
Haha... I feel like being healed just by looking at the cute Amitoi.
Just let me know if you need treatment. 
I really need the medicinal herbs I ordered to arrive soon...
The pain might get worse at night. Please take some medicine if you're sick.
You should wear thicker clothes when the weather is cold.
Everyone should be wearing raincoats.
We have the Resistance to thank for the peace we enjoy in this area.
Thankfully, we didn't have too many patients today.
I should prepare tomorrow's medicine in advance.
Be careful not to slip in the snow.
You'll catch a cold if you're in the rain too long.
I'm seeing more and more travelers getting heatstroke these days.
You have to be careful not to get dehydrated in this region.
Does anyone need pain relievers?
You don't want to get wet from the rain.
Yes, anything I can help?
Curing the sick is the healer's calling!
Ugh! It's already night...
Wow! Snow!
The sound of rain helps heal the mind.
It's always amazing to see a solar eclipse.
When it rains, the energy of plants becomes stronger. Be careful of violent plants.
There is no asset as precious in the world as health!
Watch out for traps when you walk around the Territory.
You have to focus if you don't want to lose your prey.
I should call it quits for today. Anyway, tomorrow will be a new day.
The weather is no good today. I should just go home.
What's with this wind all of a sudden?
The rain will make all my prey run away!
You have to be wise when choosing your prey.
I can't go back empty-handed today...
Night will fall soon. You should head back now. It's dangerous to hunt at night.
The smell of animals gets stronger in rain.
Your weapon tells me you're not some run-of-the-mill hunter.
Are you here to hunt wolves, too?
The wolves are on guard. It won't be easy to hunt today.
Don't go after the ones that are sleeping at night. You may put your own life at risk.
Are you a veteran hunter? You look like you've got quite a bit of experience.
Once the Wolf Hunting Contest starts, the wolves will get confused and they'll be much easier to hunt.
I can't see any prey. It must be because of the goblins.
I won't catch anything at this rate. Perhaps I should move further out.
I should head back now. Hunting at night is basically gambling with your life.
Should I go home...? It's raining, after all...
You look like you know what you're doing. A run-of-the-mill hunter doesn't have the flair that you do.
When the Starlight Stones Ritual starts, the goblins go wild. It's a perfect opportunity for hunters.
Welcome! Please let me know if you need anything.
Come, come! Take a seat!
Are you going to have dinner?
A bowl of stew will warm you up from the snow. What do you say?
I hope no one left the window open while it's raining.
I have tons of mead. Drink all you like!
We're getting a lot of customers today. Maybe the flyers did the trick?
Boy, today was busy. Would you look at the time?
It's cold out, huh? How about a mug of warm mead?
Would you look at the weather? Come in and rest up.
Hm... Interesting...
I think I found something new to research.
Oh, dear! I've never seen the rain suddenly pour down like that!
This rain in unnatural, so magic must be involved somehow.
But I can't change my research topic this late.
When are my research materials going to arrive?
I need to finish my research if I want to go back to Venelux.
I need to get an accurate measurement of the land's contaminant.
I can sense it. You're an incredibly experienced adventurer.
Elter is creating Purification Fragments with help from adventurers. You should help, too.
I can still feel the remnants of dark magic...
This place is filled with the tragic story of our wizards...
I'll research further.
Perhaps I can finish my research within a few days.
The Starlight Stones were created with an old spell of the goblins.
The goblins' spell is quite primitive.
If we could identify the contaminant, things would be a little better...
Is there a way to spray the magical reagent {EOL}without touching the seawater...?
I'm worried that I won't be able to spray it on the contaminant as the magical reagent duration is too short...
I jumped through hoops to move the contaminant ^<c=@Codex_ACH_HN>below the cliff above the remains of the wrecked ship ^</c>.
What do you need?
Don't bother me unless you're here to talk business.
If you want to be efficient during the day, you have to rest at night.
What's the problem?
Do you need a mercenary?
Night shifts require more rewards.
What's your business?
Body type is irrelevant to mercenary work. Getting the job done well is what matters.
The guards should provide protection of this place at night. We only take jobs that pay.
Don't bother me while I'm working.
Rule number one. No pay, no work.
You've gotta stay low when it's dark.
With that much experience under your belt, I bet you could do anything with ease. Are you interested in any mercenary work by any chance?
Everyone's gone to hunt the rampaging monsters of the Wasteland. If it pays well, I should try it out, too.
Come closer and take a look! I'll show you all the goods I have.
We've got lots of good items in stock. Come on over!
Time sure flies, doesn't it?
Oh, no, it's raining! My goods are going to get wet!
Nobody said it was going to rain today!
Mead materials for sale! Enjoy mead in the comfort of your home!
Just let me know if you need anything. I have other goods in stock.
It's already time to close up.
Would you like to take a look? I have lots of exclusive items!
Uncommon cloth for sale! It's made of high-quality Moonlight Scales!
Sales were pretty good today. I should go home and rest.
Most of my goods are supplies. Why don't you take a look?
It's pretty quiet today...
When did it get so dark? I'd better call it a day.
Experienced adventurers like you would probably have a good eye for items. Give us a try!
The others went to Fonos Basin. I heard they need to stop the orcs?
How about some Starcluster Flower Pollen? It can brighten up your complexion.
We have all sorts of items, so take your time.
Phew... What a day. It's about time I get some well-earned rest.
Haven't we met before? You have the air of a seasoned adventurer. 
Aren't you going to the Urstella Fields? Everyone else went there to collect Stardust.
You can't find prices like this anywhere else!
We have goods straight from the port. Come take a look.
I'm tidying up at the moment.
Oh, I didn't even make a penny today. Please, just go.
Your weapon looks quite expensive. I have some items that'll match perfectly! Why don't you take a look?
You're the Sentry of the Rye Fields! Since you're a special customer, I'll give you a special price!
Guild activities require a lot of supplies, which we always carry in stock. Have a look!
I heard you're quite famous. Thank you for choosing us. I'll give you a special discount!
Your Amitoi is very clever. I'd like one myself if they had an Amitoi for merchants.
Are you here to buy Vienta wine? There are several different types in stock.
Aside from Vienta wine, we boast a variety of other goods, too. Take your time looking around!
I'm all done tidying up. I should head home now.
My goodness. Where is the guard?
That's a very precious weapon. I can tell because I used to sell weapons, too.
I hear people are calling you the Sandstorm Warrior.
Gift your guild members some Vienta Wine from our store!
I heard you're famous! Let me know if anything catches your eye. I'll give it to you at a fair price!
Your Amitoi is very smart.
You must be from the {gva_PcGuildName} guild. Anything you're looking for?
We're all in trouble because of the taxes.
This place is open to wholesale, too.
Our store also manages retail, so take your time and look around.
Oh, I'm so tired. I'm going home now.
That's strange. There are some suspicious people at the castle.
I would love to sell a nice weapon like that in our shop.
We have a selection of gift options which your guild members would appreciate.
I heard you're pretty famous...
Oh! That Amitoi is adorable!
You must be from the {gva_PcGuildName} guild. Is there something you need?
I can't sleep well when I'm stressed out about taxes...
Haven't you heard? They say that the merchants at the Sanctuary Oasis are the best.
Welcome. Our shop guarantees the high quality of our goods.
I should go home and rest now.
You're a veteran adventurer, aren't you? I've been in the trade market long enough to know a skilled adventurer when I see one.
You're not going to the Wasteland? Everyone went over there to stop those rampaging monsters.
Go ahead and take a look! We have everything you need and more!
Half price goods for sale! Don't miss this special opportunity!
I'm cleaning up right now. Can you come back tomorrow?
Where did I put my weapon...?
You've got a fine weapon there. You should engrave your name on it so it won't get stolen.
You're the Full Moon Reaper! It's so much easier to pick up goods, thanks to you.
You didn't come with your guild members? I can give you a better price if you buy in bulk.
You're the one everyone's talking about! It's so nice to meet you in person.
I've never seen an Amitoi this cute before.
You're from the {gva_PcGuildName} guild? Is there something you need?
I get so frustrated every time I think about taxes.
You don't have to buy it. Take your time to look around.
This is also good for gifts.
Time for a Rainy Day Sale! You can't beat these prices!
Well, would you look at the time! I'll sell them off.
We've added new products, so take a look!
Just buy it once. You will be really satisfied.
Haam... Oh, I yawned without knowing it.
I need to sweep the storefront well so that people will not slip on the snow.
Oh no, I'll have to cover it with a tarp to keep it from getting wet with rain.
What's going on in the sky again? So scared.
Oh, it's cold! The eaves are totally useless.
Wow, you're wearing awesome equipment! No worries when going on an adventure.
How do you wipe out monsters like that? Thank you.
Competing for first and second place among the Resistance Soldiers, you must have large expenditures, right?
Amitoi are all cute. Yours is really cute, too.
Did you call me?
I haven't seen you around. How can I help you?
Oh! It's time to go home.
Snow?! My shoes will be ruined at this rate.
What do I do... My clothes will be ruined because of the rain.
It's my first time here, too. I need a gentleman to show me around Laslan.
Where should I go to see the lord?
Huh? When did the sun set? I should go before rogues appear.
The white snow is so romantic. The only thing is that it leaves my shoes all soaking wet.
If I had known it would rain, I never would have left the house!
Is it your first time in Stonegard? Be careful of sunburn!
Yes? Do you need something from me?
Evening gatherings are much better than daytime gatherings.
Who knew it would rain today? 
You need a parasol on days like this.
The town inn is more useful than I thought.
Have you listened to the bard's performance in the Liberation Plaza? It's truly impressive.
The night sky is beautiful.
Oh, dear... It'll be freezing cold before you know it.
All my newly tailored clothes will get wet!
There are dangerous people wherever you go.
I like your weapon. I wish I had one to display in our house.
I heard you're the Wolf Slayer! It's an honor to meet you in person.
Can you tell me about your guild? I've always been so curious about what guilds do.
I heard you're incredibly talented. I'm delighted to make your acquaintance.
Oh! Isn't that an Amitoi? I wish I had one, too.
Don't the grapes smell so good? I wish they'd make a perfume out of them.
I don't particularly like wine, but Vienta Wine is a different story.
I like the night breeze in this area.
The aroma of fresh grapes and rain is so lovely.
Oh... I think you have the wrong person.
That looks like a special weapon. Did you make it yourself?
I hear you're never hot. Still, you should be careful of heatstroke.
I heard you have to join a guild to become successful these days. Is that true?
Oh, you're more respectable than I thought. I'd like to invite you for a banquet at my house.
Are all Amitoi that clever? They're so fascinating...
I've always wanted to meet the lord in person. I wonder what he's like.
All anyone ever talks about is taxes. 
Let's see... Do I have everything I need?
If it's about trading, come talk to me.
I ran all my errands today. I should go rest now.
Phew... It's snowing? The roads are going to be slippery.
My goods are going to get wet. I should make a raincoat even if it costs me a bit.
There are many opportunities for trade in Laslan. Wolf hide has become all the rage again.
Where was I supposed to go next...?
Wine isn't the only thing that's good in Stonegard. The desert is full of treasure if you look carefully.
Darn this sandstorm! I can taste sand in my mouth! Blegh!
I wonder if I'll ever have a proper roof over my head someday...
Life really isn't easy...
I starved all day again...
It's so cold... I'm sure no one would notice if I froze to death, though...
I'd better wash my clothes while it's raining...
I didn't want a life of poverty...
Don't pity me if you're not going to help.
How long do I have to live like this?
The weather is so strange...
I'd better collect some rainwater to drink...
Can you share me some food?
Living hand to mouth is really the best I can do.
I survived another day...
Ugh... It's snowing.
What's with the weather?
May Einar's light guide you...
Just let me know if you need any help.
May Einar's light be with you in the darkness...
If you have a problem with your ship, you're better off asking the captain.
This port is fairly well managed.
A nice cold drink is the perfect way to end a hard day.
Snow just makes everything harder.
My to-do list only gets longer when it rains!
I see more people at the port these days. I wonder if they're all travelers.
This work comes with its hardships, but it pays pretty well.
I'm so busy. How does the day go by so fast? 
Things will only get harder if the ground freezes up. I should hurry and clean up.
I'm not sure if the ship will set sail when it's raining.
You can smell the wine, huh? It's the most commonly traded good here at Vienta Port.
I get hungry so fast when I'm working. I wonder if anyone's selling snacks?
Another busy day. I can't wait to go home and rest!
Why is it snowing all of a sudden?
I don't like when it rains at the port...
I would do anything to get my health back...
I can barely remember what life was like before I got sick. I hope I get well soon...
As the night wears on, my headaches get worse and I find it difficult to sleep.
I can't wait to get well and go see the snow.
It's raining. That explains my sore knees since yesterday...
The sky is looking pretty strange today.
It's pouring... Everything should be okay, right?
You've got some nice equipment. You must be having some great adventures.
It's in times like this that I thank my lucky stars I work at the Stonemasons' Association.
If we collect enough Brown Mica, I'm sure we can rebuild the Abandoned Stonemason Town.
While the adventurers defeat the monsters, we'll gather the Brown Mica. It's a win-win situation!
There's no end to studying when you're a trainee.
I'll be a full-fledged wizard by next year. Of course, I'll have to pass about three tests...
I'm sure I'll pass the performance test tomorrow.
Oh, is that not it? I'll have to check out another book.
I've too many projects to work on...
Could I become a great wizard if I gain as much experience as you?
Everyone followed Elter to go collect Purification Fragments.
Perfect weather for training!
How far should we go today?
It's too dark to see very well. Should I go inside soon?
It's raining, so the air feels cool and nice! Shall we practice a little more before going in?
This is my first time here. I'm so excited!
Hm... Where should I go first?
I should find a place to stay before it gets too late.
Oh? It's snowing?
It's raining? I haven't even found a place to stay yet!
So this must be Laslan!
This area is great for traveling!
Well, would you look at the time?
It seems to snow here quite often!
I heard the wine here is quite famous! The fragrance and taste are supposed to be extraordinary.
Phew... It's way too hot.
This place is much nicer at night.
Snow? In the desert?!
The rain is actually quite refreshing.
I heard there's a gem called the Urstella Star in this region.
I can't go to the fields because of the goblins.
Did you know you can climb on top of that pillar? They say you can use a hook... Even if you were bold enough to try it, how would that even work?
They say I can make money by picking up Terror Bird's eggs and selling them... I'm scared, though, since Terror Birds are so wild and dangerous.
On a rainy day like this, I think of a scary story that's been spread around here.
Don't go north at night. If you do, don't say I didn't warn you!
Are you traveling, too?
Let's go to the most famous restaurant here!
I walked around too much today. Let's go get some rest.
I feel relieved when it snows.
When it rains, the streets become quiet.
Oh, look at the sky!
Darn, my clothes are all wet! You have any extra clothes?
If I had a weapon like that, I could travel more safely, right?
Are you by any chance the adventurer famous for defeating monsters?
Are you by any chance the very person who is famous for being the strongest adventurer?
A cute Amitoi. Can I buy one in this village?
Take advantage of Talandre's specialty, the Breezeline.
Travel through Talandre on the Breezeline.
It's dark. Be careful getting on and off the Breezeline.
Take a ride in the Breezeline and watch the snow fall.
There aren't many passengers because it's raining.
Err, what's wrong with the sky all of a sudden?
It's very rainy and windy. Please try not to move around too much around the Breezeline.
You have a good weapon! All awesome adventurers use this Breezeline
Oh, welcome! I hear you're one of the best adventurers in Solisium!
Thank you so much for choosing the Breezeline. Th-the platform is just over there.
Mm... Should I charge Amitoi, too?
I'm working right now. Is it important?
Let's talk another time. I have to finish my work. 
Great! Today's work is done.
Snow? Are you kidding me?
I'm going to get all wet. I should hurry up.
I have way too much work to do. I'm not complaining, though.
When will I finish all this?
Just one last thing and I'm done for the day. I want to hurry home and relax.
No wonder the wind felt cold today. It was because of the snow!
It's raining all of a sudden? I hate rain when I'm working!
It's not easy to work under the sun every day.
I wish people would stop drinking so much and do their jobs right. I feel like I'm the only one working here.
As soon as the weather cools down, the sun seems to set right away.
It's a good time to harvest grapes since they're ripe now.
I've almost harvested my quota today.
It's hard to work because of hot weather, so I think it's better that it rains.
Ha-ah~ I'm tired. I need to pick a few more grapes and then I'll go home.
Salt water is rough, so I'm always repairing our ship.
I heard Saurodoma Island is far away... Is it a place where only lizards live?
It's raining, so the salt will be washed away.
Isn't it quite romantic to see the twinkling fireflies at night?
I don't wanna go home! I wanna keep playing!
I'll catch a cold in the rain!
Huh? It's already night?
Huh? The sun is suddenly missing?
Ack, I'm all wet!
How can I join the Resistance?
I'll be a great hero like DaVinci when I grow up!
Why do I have to sleep at night?
Let's make a snowman!
Eek, it's cold! I'm going home!
Am I hot? Why should I when I'm playing?
I'm bored! I don't like it!
It's really fun to play at night...
Mom! It's snowing!
Whoa, it's raining!
The sun is too bright.
Wanna play with me?
If you have questions, ask a grown-up. I'm just a kid.
I feel great today!
Oh, I hate going to sleep...
Everyone, it's snowing!
It's raining? I'll hide under the eaves.
Y-you aren't going to kill me, right?
Wow, the Wolf Slayer? I heard they were really ferocious!
Why haven't you joined a guild? Aren't you lonely?
Wow, what's the name of that cool Amitoi?
Are you really the famous ^<c=@MK_D_Dialogue>{gva_PcName}^</c>? Wow!
Your outfit is really dazzling!
My dad's having a lot of trouble because of those unruly Harvesters. Are you here to help him out?
These Harvesters are crazy!
My mom will be worried. I'd better get home.
I've got to clean the warehouse roof when it snows. Otherwise, it'll collapse.
Uh, my mom told me to come in when it rains...
Please take good care of the Rye Fields!
Wow, the toy moves!
I heard from some guy in the Resistance that you can get good armor for doing a contract.
^<c=@MK_D_Dialogue>{gva_PcName}^</c>? Glad to have someone as strong as you protecting our humble farm.
It's all desert around our village. What did you come to see?
You can smell the grapes from here.
Let's play, everyone!
What's this fluffy white stuff?
It's raining? The grapes will grow well!
D-Did you kill people?
Wow, did you kill a lot of Sandworms? Aren't you scared at all?
Are you really not hot? I sure am!
You seem to like traveling alone. Aren't you lonely?
I want to have an awesome friend like your Amitoi!
Wow, you're ^<c=@MK_D_Dialogue>{gva_PcName}^</c>? I've got to tell my friends!
Don't you have any other clothes?
When I grow up, I want to join a great guild like {gva_PcGuildName}!
All the grown-ups in town complain about taxes these days.
I want to play in the water! The water!
I want to eat yummy food.
Why can't I go out at night? I want to play at night, too!
Oh, is it raining? What's this?
The rain is refreshing!
You killed someone? You had a reason to, right?
Wow, I want to meet the Pirate King, too!
Where'd the demons come from?
Hello there, cool Amitoi!
^<c=@MK_D_Dialogue>{gva_PcName}^</c>, can I shake your hand just once? Please?
I bet you can easily kill demons with that weapon!
Mom told me to always be polite to people from the {gva_PcGuildName} guild.
I eat yummy food every day now! It's all thanks to the kind lord.
The orcs in Akidu Valley aren't like other orcs.
I hope I grow taller soon!
Oh, I'm hungry.
It's snowing? I've got to put on more clothes.
Mom! It's raining!
I heard murderers need to be put in jail.
I'm not discouraged by my size! Hai-yah!
Don't you have any friends? It's no fun adventuring alone!
My friend has an Amitoi just like yours!
Wow, ^<c=@MK_D_Dialogue>{gva_PcName}^</c>? I can't believe you're here in our town!
There's a shop in our village that sells armor.
Some Resistance guys were running toward Grayclaw Forest just now. Is something happening?
Have you been to the Titanreach Ruins?
I wanna eat the food they sell in the market...
Yawn... I'm tired.
Something white's falling from the sky!
The grown-ups like it when it rains!
People who do bad things should be punished!
My friends and I decided to make a guild when we grow up!
Wow! How's it feel to be famous like you, ^<c=@MK_D_Dialogue>{gva_PcName}^</c>?
I met a Resistance fighter with a really cool weapon a while ago!
{gva_PcGuildName} is the mightiest guild in Stonegard!
Mom and Dad are always fretting over taxes day in and day out.
I'll be a brave Resistance soldier one day!
I'm the fastest runner in my village!
I can't wait to grow up, so I can play at night.
Can you build a snowman bigger than me?
I want to go outside and play...
Err? The sun has burned out!
It's raining so hard! Look, the raindrops hurt!
Whoa, I want equipment like that! Can I have it when I grow up?
How can I be a great grown-up like you?
My mom says you're very scary. Is that true?
Whoa! I want to walk with the Amitoi, too!
Guess what? There's a monster in the Swamp of Silence that's just as small as me!
Sorry, I'm kind of busy. I'm in big trouble if I lose any sheep.
No, you can't go that way!
I should get home.
The other kids like snow, but I don't. It just looks like more wool to me.
Argh, it's raining!
Th-the sky looks weird!
Sheep are smarter than you'd think. And they're fairly strong.
One sheep, two sheep...
I've been walking all day. My legs hurt.
The sheep also like snow. Look, they're smiling.
Be careful you don't slip.
Wasn't the sky clear just a minute ago?
Looks like a storm!
The sheep obey me. I know how to handle them.
A little lamb was just born on the farm. I named it Whitey!
Oh, I'm bored.
Time to go home.
Sheep don't feel the cold. Their wool keeps them warm.
Eek, I almost slipped!
It's raining all of a sudden!
The sun changed like the moon!
The wind is really blowing!
A lot of my classmates are at the Purelight Tower, but they just show off and don't play with me.
Be careful of boars because they're fierce.
Do you know of the scary tree monster at Aelon's Sanctuary? Actually, it used to be a nice tree that protected us...
It's already gotten dark.
Ugh, it's cold!
Phew, it's raining again.
Huh? The sky was clear...
Th-the sky suddenly turned red!
The sheep better not get scared of the wind!
There's so much to study. I think my head will explode at this rate.
Yes, what is it?
I'm sleepy...
Last time my clothes got wet, Leon dried them with magic!
I want to stop studying and build a snowman today...
The sky is red. Is some really powerful wizard using magic?
When will I become a full-fledged wizard?
Do you know how to use magic, adventurer?
That's enough studying for today.
Did you know? There's a strange circle on the Purelight Hill where grass never grows even after rain.
I hope the snow keeps coming down!
I'm going to Venelux when I'm older to train with the world's greatest wizards.
This used to be a wasteland where nothing ever grew. Now it's become a forest!
If you go to the Purelight Hill, you'll stumble across a frightening area with a cursed tree...
Why is it called the Purelight Tower? Because it was built to purify land cursed by magic.
The old name of the Purelight Hill was Aelon Hill. I read that in a history book today!
Magic Schema are so hard!
I wonder how Venelux looks like.
I've still got so much left to study!
Could this be magic?
Ugh, it's wet.
I don't mind the cold! I've got fire magic.
You're going to help with purifying the area, too, right, Adventurer?
I don't go to the forest much because the trees are scary! You're really something.
Did you know? Amitoi were originally invented in Venelux.
I'm going to have fun playing again today!
Where'd that book go?
Oh, it got dark. But I want to keep playing...
I'll have to make a snowman in this weather.
Oh! There's this fun game you can do when it's raining!
Huh? It's night already?
(Sigh) I'm bored. Please, tell me an interesting story.
My parents are close with the lord.
I should ask grandmother to tell me a scary story!
Hehe, I should read a book and drink some milk.
Ack! My book can't get wet.
Huff, huff. Did I run too much? Aren't you hot?
What should I play with today?
Phew, this is refreshing.
Wow! I was so thirsty, but there's water here.
Wow, this is perfect weather for running around!
Do you know what the kids in the neighboring village do for play?
You're not from here, right? I want to go across the sea like you!
I will go on adventures when I grow up!
Huh? Mother, it got dark.
More snow is coming!
If I run fast, I won't get hit, right?
It's not night yet. How did this happen?
Don't come too close.
Wow, how do you hunt wolves?
Lobster Maniac? Do you eat Chestaceans?
Are you thinking about what guild to join?
Do you get to meet new friends when you join a guild? I'm jealous!
That's a very cool Amitoi.
^<c=@MK_D_Dialogue>{gva_PcName}^</c>, please take good care of our town.
Wow, your weapon is shiny...
Have you been to the ruins outside the castle? I want to go, but I can't because it's dangerous.
How did people build such a big castle? I'm so curious.
Yawn... Sleep tight, Adventurer!
I wish it snowed every day!
The ground is slippery in the rain.
W-why are you looking at me with those scary eyes?
Wow, your Amitoi looked at me and smiled!
If I train every day, can I become strong like you, ^<c=@MK_D_Dialogue>{gva_PcName}^</c>? You're amazing!
Adventurer, did you inherit those clothes from someone else?
Please keep our castle safe again today!
Adults say our lord is a great person!
Adventurer, have you tried our village's wine?
Sienna Parsons is the prettiest person in the whole world!
Do I have to wash up before going to sleep again today? Ugh...
Yay! I don't have to wash up if the rain does it for me.
Killing people is bad!
I'm going to cross the Moonlight Desert on a camel when I grow up!
Haven't you joined a guild yet?
Adventurer, can I say hi to your Amitoi?
My friends will all be jealous when I tell them I met ^<c=@MK_D_Dialogue>{gva_PcName}^</c>!
Do you also know the lord of Stonegard? Wow!
The grown-ups get angry if I run all over the place. We want to play, too...
I'm bored.
Is it dinnertime already?
Wow, snow! It's snowing!
Mom, it's raining! Should I wash?
Oh, it's suddenly dark!
Oh, sorry. Did I do something wrong?
When I grow up and earn money, I will eat 'till I'm stuffed.
I smell food from over there...
I hate going home...
Why do people hate poor kids? Is there something wrong with not having money?
Why are you doing that?
What's outside the village?
Oh, I'm starving...
I don't like being cold...
Whoa, it's raining! Rainwater is so refreshing!
The sky looks weird!
Even without any toys, you can still play a lot with tree branches and rocks.
My hobby is going to market and sniffing the food there! It doesn't cost me anything to do that.
Thank you, Resistance adventurer!
I think my toes are frozen...
I'm going to buy shoes when I grow up.
With bare feet, I don't slip even when it rains!
I've got to play in the mud!
I've never seen a red sky before!
Mom... I'm sick...
My body aches too much...
I'm so cold...
Achoo! Ugh, it's wet...
H-hu... Uh...
My stomach aches...
I want to meet a new friend here, too.
I want to keep playing in the dark!
Whoa, it's snowing?
Mom, let's get back inside fast!
Huh? Now it's raining?
Huh? Now it's suddenly night?
It's my first time in Laslan.
I don't want to go inside yet.
A lot of snow falls here.
It's too hot here.
I can't play in the day 'cause it's hot, and I can't play at night 'cause it's dark...
Raindrops are falling!
Desert traveling is the hardest. I think I'm going to die in the heat!
I like the night. I can see the stars well!
Mom said it doesn't snow much here!
The rain is so refreshing!
Hey, are the Akidu orcs really tall?
Are you the hero who fended off the wolf people? Wow!
There are lots of famous guilds in the village where I was born!
Wow, that Amitoi is so cute!
Everywhere I go, I'm going to brag that I got to meet ^<c=@MK_D_Dialogue>{gva_PcName}^</c>!
My clothes are old, but your clothes look even older!
Grayclaw Forest has become a mess because of the lycans' spell!
A trainee is only like half a wizard...
I'm so bent on becoming a wizard.
Should I go home...?
You can still study even if you're not a genius. That's what training is about.
I want to become a great person like you.
Go to Elter. He needs your help.
No matter how hard the training is, I won't give up.
The professor in charge is away again. Typical. Just as you can expect from wizards...
Don't worry about the boat. She's goin' where she needs to go.
How far are we? Go take a walk around the deck if you're bored.
Hm, It's been a while since I've been to Stonegard.
You can go anywhere with just a map and compass.
I'd best get some rest before the next voyage.
I'll drink all I want tonight.
Haha, rain in Stonegard... Now that's a sight to behold.
Hello. Did you have a question for me?
Yes? Do you need something?
I'm tired now that I'm done with work.
It's snowing.
Phew, I'd better get home quickly.
Huh? Why's it dark all of a sudden?
What's going on? It's suddenly pitch-black.
There's no companion as welcome as an Amitoi on a lonely journey of adventure!
Goodness, what's with this sudden rainstorm?!
Of course this would happen when Captain DaVinci isn't on the island. Argh...
What would have happened without DaVinci...
You should be careful in the dark.
What's with all this snow?
I'll be soaked in rain at this rate.
This town exists thanks to DaVinci.
Go to Laslan Port if you want to travel and see more of the world.
I'd better get home.
Goodness, it's cold. Bad weather.
Rain is better than snow.
Everything's drying out because of the air around here.
Even the desert can be a good place to live.
It's cool now that the sun has set.
Snow in the desert?!
It hasn't rained in so long.
It gets hotter the more you mention it.
The port is the pride of Kastleton.
It's safe even at night nowadays because it's guarded.
I need to sweep up the snow.
Snow and rain are equally annoying.
You're quite something. But you should be on your guard here.
Oho, so you're the Rye Fields Sentry. Truly amazing!
Where'd that weapon come from? Surely you didn't steal it?
So, you've joined the {gva_PcGuildName} guild. Wise choice.
Adventures can't be boring when you're with an Amitoi!
The best adventurer at the moment is {gva_LevelRankerNames0}. {gva_LevelRankerNames1} is following right after.
These are the Golden Rye Pastures.
This year's rye crop was very bountiful.
What are you doing out in the dark?
Snow again. I'd better go clear it.
You possess great skills, but there must be a reason for you to remain here.
A huge festival will be held here.
There shouldn't be any worries when it comes to the crops now.
Are you here to sightsee? Stay hydrated.
It's a big mistake to think wine is the only specialty of Vienta Village.
How is it snowing in our village?
{gva_CastleOwner_Windawood} seems to have occupied Stonegard Castle.
People like us also need to keep an eye on the tax rate. Damn, it's gone up a bit.
Oh! I... No. Please go.
Oh! You're the Sandstorm Warrior. Welcome.
Hey, that weapon is shining.
I heard the {gva_PcGuildName} guild is recruiting new guild members. Is it true?
What do you think? Aren't Amitoi useful in a fight?
Do you know where I can go see {gva_LevelRankerNames0}? The strongest person in all of Solisium?
Grapes drink up the rain.
Go to a shop if you'd like to buy something. Why ask me?
It's hard to find water nearby except here.
There's nothing to do at night. I should go inside.
Wait, why is it snowing?
The {gva_CastleOwner_Windawood} guild has been very active. I heard they occupied Stonegard Castle.
If the tax rate is raised too high, I won't stay still.
Haha, rain is my customer today.
This place is called Canina Village.
Canina Village was founded even before Vienta Village.
I'd better get home quick.
What's with this weather all of a sudden?
I don't know anything. I didn't see anything.
Full Moon Reaper, I welcome you on behalf of Canina Village.
Your weapon emits light. You must be a great fighter to wield such a thing.
So, you're a member of the {gva_PcGuildName} guild. Our village is the biggest north of Stonegard.
Little friend, do you like our town?
I've heard {gva_LevelRankerNames0} is the strongest in Solisium. I wonder how they're doing.
Since it's raining, I'd better collect this water for later use.
Traditionally, a market is a place where buyers and sellers meet.
It's a lot of fun to see various people in the market.
Um... Raining, but I still have to buy what I need, right?
There may be shops that don't close even after dark.
The sacrifices and achievements left behind by comrades will be remembered forever.
My comrade was a really pleasant fellow.
When it rains, I come to this place thinking of my departed comrade.
It would be nice to enjoy a drink with a comrade on a night like tonight...
This Lord's Residence is also being used as a guild office thanks to the consideration of the Lord.
DaVinci Aron also visits the Lord's Residence often.
Take shelter from the rain at the Lord's Residence.
The Lord's Residence is always open, even late at night.
It's terrible to think of the days when Fernan monopolized everything.
Do you know that the water level in the oasis goes down when it doesn't rain enough.
It's raining? Heh heh, it'll get even chillier.
Look up at the sky at night. Very full of stars.
A good balance between work and rest is the key to staying healthy.
You must learn to find satisfaction and happiness in the little things in life.
There were more stars in the night sky when I was a kid...
Walking with your hands in your pockets makes it easy to slip on the snow.
Aw, cold!
Hm... A solar eclipse? What a surprise!
Such a downpour all of a sudden. What's going on?
You're young, and you've got some good equipment. You must be quite the adventurer.
What an honor to meet the adventurer I've only heard rumors about!
I-it's an honor to meet the adventurer I've only heard about.
Any adventure would be fun with such a cute Amitoi!
Have you heard of the monster in the Swamp of Silence? They say it's small, but very fierce.
Nothing like a good drink.
Our town makes the best alcohol.
Nothing like a drink after work to refresh yourself.
Shall I order some more snacks?
Gotta check the weather, gotta check the date. A farmer's lifelong knowledge is worth gold.
I hope today would pass by without any problems.
I should wrap up before night falls...
It's a good thing we piled up the straw in advance.
Good. This would make today's work easier.
I can make a living since Lord Hobs cut taxes. 
I can't believe my crops are going to be exported through the port!
I'd best wrap up and go back home.
I need to prepare some firewood.
The rain is a welcome relief.
If this rain keeps up, I'm worried it'll knock down all the fruit.
I'm very grateful to the wizards! Thanks to them, we can even cultivate grapes in a desert like this.
Farming is truly honest work.
Time to finish up and go home.
Small islands are usually infertile, but not us, thanks to Whisperion.
Owww, my back. I'd better rest today.
Nothing to report.
I'm on duty.
State your business.
What a downpour. Someone must have used magic.
It's best to get out of the rain when it's like this.
My duty is to protect Laslan.
Please report anyone suspicious to me.
This region is controlled by the Resistance. What brings you here?
Guild {gva_PcGuildName}. It's an honor to meet you.
We need to protect Stonegard.
No matter how broad the region, it must well-guarded.
What is it? It's dangerous to wander at night.
I'm surveilling the orcs.
A watchman must never forget their duties.
I want to be strong like you. Just wait and see.
The orcs are holding a Festival of Fire. This is our only opportunity to attack. Let's hurry.
Who goes there?! Hey, don't startle me.
The Ruins of Turayne are dangerous. Be careful.
Be careful. The undead could show up anytime.
Your skills are adequate enough to work here.
Have you heard about the Dark Destroyers? We're trying to stop them, but we are not strong enough. Please help.
Don't assume you'll have an advantage because the wolves are asleep. They'll awake and attack all at once.
Do you think you can show off your skills here?
Where did all these wolves come from? I really don't know.
I am on duty.
